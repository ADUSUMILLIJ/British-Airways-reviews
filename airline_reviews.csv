AB Aviation,"✅Trip Verified|  Moroni to Moheli. Turned out to be a pretty decent airline. Online booking worked well, checkin and boarding was fine and the plane looked well maintained. Its a very short flight - just 20 minutes or so so i didn't expect much but they still managed to hand our a bottle of water and some biscuits which i though was very nice. Both flights on time."
AB Aviation,"✅Trip Verified| Moroni to Anjouan. It is a very small airline. My ticket advised me to turn up at 0800hrs which I did. There was confusion at this small airport. I was then directed to the office of AB Aviation which was still closed. It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems. Not a good airline but it is the only one for Comoros."
AB Aviation,"✅Trip Verified|  Anjouan to Dzaoudzi. A very small airline and the only airline based in Comoros. Check-in was disorganised because of locals with big packages and disinterested staff. The flight was fortunately short (30 mins). Took off on time and landed on time. With a short flight like there was of course no in-flight entertainment nor cabin service except for biscuits and a bottle of water, which was quite nice!"
Adria Airways,"Not Verified|  Please do a favor yourself and do not fly with Adria. On the route from Munich to Pristina in July 2019 they lost my luggage and for 10 days in a row, despite numerous phone calls they were not able to locate it. 11 days later the luggage arrived at the destination completely ruined. Applying for compensation, they ignored my request. Foolishly again, I booked another flight with them (345 euros) Frankfurt - Pristina in September 2019. They cancelled the flight with no reason 24 hours before the departure. Desperate phone calls to customer service to get anything (rerouting, compensation, etc) were not responded. I will never fly again with Adria. What a disgrace! Shame on you Adria for constantly deceiving your customers."
Adria Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Do not book a flight with this airline! My friend and I should have returned from Sofia to Amsterdam on September 22 and 3 days before, they sent us an SMS informing the flight was cancelled. For 3 straight days we tried to reach the airline and the web agent (e-dreams) and we did not get a solution. Finally, 18 hours before our cancelled flight time, and after 35 minutes on a call (waiting), the airline was able to get us on a flight with Lufthansa. Do not book Adria Airways, it is unreliable and in our case, it ruined our last days of holidays since we needed to be on the phones all day."
Adria Airways,✅Trip Verified|  Had very bad experience with rerouted and cancelled flights last weekend with Adria airways. Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost. Do not book flights with Adria airways. I heard that their financial situation is very very bad.
Adria Airways,"Not Verified|  Ljubljana to Zürich. Firstly, Ljubljana airport is terrible. Badly trained staff, unfriendly. Toilets are very dirty. Flight 2 hours delayed without any information. There is no Information desk so questions aren‘t possible. Never again will use this airline. Its even worse than the budget airlines and thats difficult."
Adria Airways,"Not Verified|  First of all, I am not complaining about a specific flight. I am a Lufthansa frequent Flyer and I normally fly the route Munich - Timisoara. This summer season Lufthansa offered the flights on this route to Adria Airways, as they are a star alliance member. I can only tell that I have the worst experiences with them. In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows. The cabin crew is decent - not wow, not bad - but there also also situations when the staff are really rude and not customer oriented. I would recommend anyone to fly with this company. If you have the chance, book another company!"
Adria Airways,✅Trip Verified|  Worst Airline ever! They combined two flights to save costs. Instead of flying Pristina - Ljubliana - Zürich we now fly Pristina - Ljubliana - München - Zürich. Now we arrive 2.5h later at our destination.
Adria Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Ljubljana to Munich. The homebase airport of Adria Airways is Ljubljana and it very small, relaxing and convenient. It is surrounded by the Alps and the departure was fantastic. The airplane was modern and the crew was nice. Ontime departure. Drinks without alcohol were free and I paid 4€ for my white wine. Considering that I had a cheap ticket I cannot complain. Upgrades would have been available for 30€ - which includes the lounge."
Adria Airways,Not Verified|  Zurich to Ljubljana. Very poor customer service. Flight was cancelled without sending any email confirmation. The flight I was rebooked seemed to be overbooked at the beginning (which was not true)and we had to wait 30 min to have our ticket changed. Very bad experience overall.
Adria Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer. And coffee was a nuisance and they made it clear, even though it was on their cart. The questions would normally go ""would you drink anything?"" and not ""what would you like to drink?"". Very bad customer service."
Adria Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  We were traveling from Paris to Skopje on May 4th, via Ljubljana. Our flight from Ljubljana to Skopje, was canceled 10 days before our departure for no reason, leaving us in the middle of our connection at Ljubljana. Even if the company booked a hotel for us and made sure we could take a flight the next day, it prevented us from enjoying one more day in Macedonia. The company had agreed to reimburse the hostel night we had already paid but more than two months after our claim we still have no reply from the company. I e-mailed the company two times, called them on multiple occasion. The company said I would be reimbursed after 2 months. 2 months later, I still have not received anything. The experience with Adria Airways was overall very poor : - flight canceled for no reason - 2 out of 4 of the flights we took were delayed - terrible customer service, unable to give any answer to our online claim and not reimbursing the hostel night we had already paid"
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| While my journey with Aegean Airlines started pleasantly, the arrival experience at Athens Eleftherios Venizelos was highly disappointing, especially regarding handling my pets. The check-in crew at London Heathrow was friendly and helpful, but this positive experience was overshadowed by what happened upon arrival in Athens. Aegean Airlines promotes itself as pet-friendly, but my experience showed otherwise. Traveling alone with three small dogs in separate kennels, I expected clear guidance or assistance from the airline, especially since they knew I was a single passenger. Unfortunately, no instructions were given, and no representatives offered help. After a delayed luggage pickup, I was left to search for where my dogs might be. After asking an airport cleaner for help (because no one else was around, like airport representatives), I eventually located my dogs’ crates abandoned on the floor in a different section of the baggage area—an upsetting and unacceptable situation. To make matters worse, an airport staff member nearby was on her phone and didn’t care to assist or greet me. There was also no help handling the kennels on a trolley, making it incredibly difficult for pets to navigate and find transport out of the airport. For an airline that claims to be pet-friendly, this experience was far from it—terrible customer service from Aegean Airlines on the ground in Athens. I hope Aegean Airlines seriously reconsiders how it supports passengers traveling with their beloved pets to ensure smoother and safer experiences in the future."
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Upgraded to business with Plusgrade. Great value for money! Still one of the very few full service carriers with a classic service offering a welcome dring before departure and a full (hot) meal with option to choose from for the main menu. It's the small details that count with Aegean such as the cloth serviette (haven't seen this for quite some time on any medium haul with any airline) or the possibility to order a tasty Cappucino or Espresso. Additionally, typically new aircraft are used between FRA/MUC and Athens (A 320 neo/ A 321 neo) which adds to the overall excellent experience. Unfortunately, I had a short layover in Athens on my way to Paros and as the flight from Frankfurt was slightly delayed, I couldn't catch my flight to Paros. Outstanding incident handling by Aegean Airlines - they rebooked me on the first available flight next morning and sent me an SMS with a reservation confirmation at Athens Sofitel Airport hotel where complementary dinner and breakfast was offered. I had many incidents with another European Airline this year but never had such a smooth incident handling process like this. Many thanks, Aegean - you continue to be my first choice on the way to Greece!"
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   From the bag check showing up 45 min late (for the Light Fare option, an 8kg carry on limit you have to check nearly any carry on bag, total 75 euro for 1 10 kg bag round trip) to the gate change across the airport with no notice at the gate, text, email, or web, we had to run from A36 to the other end of FCO airport at A73.  Arrived 3h early and nearly missed my flight. Never again."
Aegean Airlines,"Not Verified| A constant bad experience at every flight. Delays of more than an hour are now extremely common, seats are cramped, cabin service is minimal. The flight crew are friendly and polite."
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Terrible Experience with Aegean Airlines – Lost and Damaged Bags, No Support. During a transit flight, Aegean Airlines lost my bag, and despite my repeated efforts to follow up, their customer service has stopped replying to my emails being completely careless. After two months, they still haven’t found my bag and have escaped from compensating me for the loss! To add insult to injury, they even blocked my access to their tracking page, leaving me completely in the dark! Their lack of communication, care, and basic customer service has been appalling. Worst airline experience ever! If you value your belongings and peace of mind, I strongly recommend avoiding Aegean Airlines. Save yourself the suffering!"
Aegean Airlines,✅Trip Verified|   Besides the crew which was very friendly I couldn't recognise anything of the Aegean Airlines I knew a decade ago when I used to fly Aegean frequently. I ordered a vegetarian meal which turned out to be a nasty sandwich that was inedible and a low quality chocolate granola bar. I paid extra to sit in the emergency exit but the seat was not particularly comfortable. I recommend the airline only because it took off and arrived on time.
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Aegean Airlines left us stranded and sleeping on the airport floor! This was hands down the worst airline experience of my life. We were in Venice, Italy, waiting to fly to Beirut via Athens, and no one at the counter bothered to tell us that our connecting flight from Athens to Beirut had been cancelled. We only found out once we were already on the plane, after we asked a flight attendant, who casually informed us. She reassured us that the customer help desk in Athens would take care of everything. They did nothing. In Athens, we were told it wasn't their problem, and we were left to fend for ourselves with no solution, no assistance, and no care. We were stranded in the airport, with nowhere to go, and ended up sleeping on the floor. Aegean Airlines abandoned us. To make matters worse, we’ve been sending emails, and they are completely ignoring us."
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Aegean was a very good company in recent years. It is still so during the low season (winter) where flights are on time and in the event of problems (especially weather) the support is efficient. On the other hand, their new planes are much less comfortable than the old ones with greatly reduced legroom. This negatively changes the flying experience compared to previous years. Furthermore, traveling with them in summer has become a real hell,flights are very often late (especially evening ones) with compromised connections. And no assistance, you have to figure out how to find a hotel not to mention that postponements are often automatic (without any choice possible because the suitcases are automatically sent on the flight chosen by the company) so arrival at 11:30 p.m. next flight canceled and scheduled for 4:35 a.m. No possibility of collecting the suitcases and therefore taking a later flight to rest. This is the last time I travel with them in summer.  They should give up on short connections which never work... a very good company in winter on the other hand. Aegean était une très bonne compagnie ces dernières années. Elle l'est encore lors de la basse saison (hiver) où les vols sont à l'heure et en cas de problèmes (notamment meteo) la prise en charge est efficace. Par contre leurs nouveaux avions sont bien moins confortables que les anciens avec des espaces pour les jambes fortement réduits. Cela change négativement l'expérience de vol par rapport aux années précédentes. Par ailleurs voyager avec eux en été est devenu un véritable enfer... les vols sont très souvent en retard (surtout ceux du soir) avec des correspondances compromises. Et aucune assistance c'est débrouillez vous pour trouver un hôtel ... sans comptez que les reports sont souvent automatiques (sans choix possible parce que les valises sont automatiquement envoyés sur le vol choisi par la compagnie...) ainsi arrivée à 23h30 vol suivant annulé et prévu à 4.35. Pas possible de récupérer les valises et donc de prendre un vol plus tard pour se reposer... nuit blanche à l'aéroport. C'est la dernière fois que je voyage avec eux en été... chaque année c'est de pire en pire. Ils devraient renoncer à envisager des correspondances courtes qui ne fonctionnent jamais... une très bonne compagnie en hiver en revanche."
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Pleasant and uneventful trip at a very low cost, would definitely recommend and fly again. The staff were very polite and helpful. From the people at the Aegean's lounge in Athens, to the people in the gates and the flight crew, they were happy to help with a smile on their faces. When I got to Athens airport and passed the security check I realized that I had booked economy light class, which, as the websites states, you can only carry either a hand luggage OR a personal item, but I was carrying both. I tried searching for an Aegean help desk at the terminal I was in but I couldn't find one, so I asked the staff at the lounge for directions. They told me the help desk is accessible only before the security check and asked me what the problem was to figure out if they could help. They could have just said it's not our job to help you since we are at a lounge, but they did either way. I explained the issue with the luggage and they told me I could call the Aegean's call center since they weren't informed. Even though it was 4am they picked up immediately and informed me that the rules about economy light have changed since May 2024 and that I could carry both a hand luggage and a personal item, they just didn't update the rules in their website yet. During flight they give economy class a sandwich (there's also a vegan option), cookies and a drink. There is also a website which can be visited during flight to see the location of the plane. The WiFi, unfortunately, didn't work for the majority of the duration of the flight. The only negative about this airline is the booking website. It's a bit laggy, slow, confusing and as it turns out, not regularly updated, in contrast to the mobile application which is very fast, informing and easy to use. Either way it was a pleasant experience and it's good to know you can count on professional and polite staff when in doubt, who treat you with respect regardless your class type."
Aegean Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  In every flight they have delays and lack of space, taking your carry on bag.  However every time I need to estimate an approximate delay of 30 min to one hour (to 2 hours many times, specially during summer) plus the time to wait to collect my carryon bag that will have been checked. The staff is ok but the policies and regulations are getting worse. If they want to behave as a high cost airline, they need to start providing the relevant services to their passengers."
Aer Lingus,"✅Trip Verified| Rather dismayed, especially as the IFE screens showed 4 star airline. The seat was good and leg room good for an economy seat. There was a drinks service (only one). This was in a ten hour flight. I don’t drink alcohol but there is an extra fee for this. Quite a shock for a so called 4 star airline. Acceptable on the return night flight for one drink service as it night time but during the day? I asked for two mini cans of coke and kept one for the meal. The meal was inedible and the starter disgusting. This was accompanied by tea of coffee. Then that was it, just a nice mini tub of ice cream. Then crew vanished into thin air. The galley at the back was completely empty and unattended. Then just before landing a warm filled roll (cheese and tomato). I was very disappointed they could have at least done another drinks service - it made Virgin look amazing. Virgin do two bar services and are always visible in the cabin and passing through with orange of water to keep you hydrated. The service onboard should at least match that of BA, after all they are owned by the same company."
Aer Lingus,"Not Verified| Very pleasant flight. On time and lovely staff on board, smiling faces and welcoming. We flew into a storm in Dublin but the pilot (Ciaran/Keiran) brought the plane down beautifully with hardly bump. My only gripe is the seats are tight and hold luggage fees very dear, other than that nice flight."
Aer Lingus,"Not Verified| I flew business class with Aer Lingus from IAD to LIS via DUB. On the IAD to DUB route with their A330, upon entering the plane on both ways; the pillows were dirty, used and have hair on them. I informed the FA and they just shrugged and handed me new pillows. The flight was delayed, so the FAs have plenty of time to replace the pillow but evidently, they just don't care. The lie flat seats were narrow and cramp but the worst part is the foot rest. I do not have giant feet but when you lie flat, you can barely fit your feet into the wedged shaped foot rest, which made it hard to sleep. The food and drinks were fine. We just had champagne and water. The crew were just apathetic in their attitude just like the typical economy class ones. The IFE have standard selections. I believe it have the same selections as the economy class ones."
Aer Lingus,"Not Verified|  Aer Lingus left my luggage and the luggage of over 2 dozen people. They still have not bothered to return it. They simply claim it is out for delivery. This cannot be true. It is only 2 hours 10 minutes from Dublin to Galway. They could have delivered it 5 times by now. They even lied claiming it was the first item on the list, first stop that would be made."
Aer Lingus,✅Trip Verified| The seats are disgusting unfortunately. I was in row 28 and my seat felt like it was about to collapse. The coffee and tea stains all over the tray table were also very visible. This is a 07:20am flight out of Dublin. It will be its first flight so clearly the plane was not cleaned over night. I moved to row 27 as it was not occupied. And all 3 of these seats were even more filthy. The tray tables all disgusting with coffee and tea stains. Clearly not cleaned or disinfected. The safety demonstration card had gum attached to it and every duty free magazine is gross. Page edges all curling up and the edges are dark from so many people touching them for months. The variety of A320 types are also disappointing. Ironically the older A320s have better seats. More leg room and adjustable headrests. The new A320/321Neos are extremely uncomfortable. No adjustable headrest and no seat recline.
Aer Lingus,"Not Verified|  We recently had a very frustrating experience with Aer Lingus on flight EI429 from Pisa to Dublin on 18 August 2024. Despite arriving at the gate only three minutes late, we were denied boarding, even though the plane was still on the tarmac, near us, with the stairs down and the door open. The ground staff refused to let us board without even checking with the crew, which was completely unreasonable. To make matters worse, the staff showed no willingness to assist or explain the situation. They ignored our requests for clarification, even though we later discovered that the flight left with a delay of over an hour. This made their decision even more unacceptable. We have contacted Aer Lingus multiple times via email to seek clarification and assistance, but have received no response. The lack of customer service and basic communication is shocking. Due to this situation, we had no choice but to take four different modes of transportation (taxis and trains, all at additional cost) to reach Milan, where we finally managed to depart in the late evening, having to purchase new tickets once again with Aer Lingus I strongly urge Aer Lingus to reconsider how they handle customer situations and offer timely responses. Based on this experience, I cannot recommend this airline to others."
Aer Lingus,"✅Trip Verified|   Our second leg on this plane. The first was from Manchester to Belfast. There is no business class available for this flight but Economy Flex offered lounge access. We were allocated row 1 A&C which sounds great until you realise that the only passenger door, aside from emergency exits is at the rear of the plane. Consequently, we were almost the first onboard but the last off. Not such a big deal as the aircraft has only 72 seats. There is a trolley service on this one hour flight but we didn't bother, there seemed little point in paying for overpriced snacks and drinks. No IFE or Wi-fi on these flights. Cabin crew of two were pleasant and professional and that is about all you can say."
Aer Lingus,"✅Trip Verified|   This airline is still living in the 20th century. Their app doesn’t display changed bookings, the app displays incorrect boarding & gate closure times, and the app doesn’t display your gate at all. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Our first flight out of Chicago was delayed by an hour. They first said it was due to sanitizing the plane, but the pilot later admitted the aircraft had brake issues. Fine. We got to our layover late due to this (again, fine - these things happen). But there were no Aer Lingus personnel to be found anywhere near our gate that just closed to our connecting flight around 8am local time. We walked down past several gates and found an Aer Lingus gate agent that was just standing there. She asked us to wait so she could walk us to claim our baggage and take us through security again. 25 minutes passed before she called us to follow her. This was a red flag - a normal airline would have had us booked on the next flight immediately. Anyway, she walked us through some doors and asked us to wait there for her. She never came back! After 1/2 hour, we took it upon ourselves to find our luggage and go through customs to do so. Only one of our checked bags was found, and they had transferred it to our new flight that was already booked. Remember, this agent had us waiting around and walking all around the airport for no reason. We finally got on our next flight and landed in Rome another hour later than the rebooked flight was supposed to land! What a terrible experience. And not only that, but our three hour flight from Dublin to Rome didn’t even include a complimentary snack or water! Everything was at a cost. My God, What terrible service. We then spent hours at the luggage help desk and on the phone with Aer Lingus in an attempt to get our lost luggage. Their call center was clearly overseas and they were pretty useless. Luckily we had an AirTag in our luggage so we knew it made it to Rome. We sent proof of this to Aer Lingus per their request and they said they’d find it and send it to our resort. We called daily for updates, and each agent knew less than the previous. Luggage never arrived. We bought all new clothing. At the end of our trip, we asked a Rome airport agent (not Aer Lingus, just an airport agent) if we could check the lost baggage area. She let one of us in and we found it immediately. Needless to say, we’ll never fly with Aer Lingus again. Horrible, horrible airline."
Aer Lingus,"✅Trip Verified|   On August 24, 2024, my Daughter and I attempted to travel from Amsterdam to Seattle via Dublin. The flight, EI605, was scheduled to depart Amsterdam at 1:15 pm. We arrived at the Aer Lingus counter to check in at 10:30 am. There were already 25-30 people in front of us waiting in line and no gate agent insight. By 11:30 am, there were at least 200 people waiting in line to check in. When I called the Aer Lingus number for the Netherlands and asked where the gate agents were I was told, “They usually show up 45 minutes before the flight departs”. At 11:32 a single gate agent showed up and started checking people in. 20 minutes later, a British Airways gate agent who had finished checking people for a British Airways flight next to us, walked over to an empty counter and started helping. By the time a third gate agent arrived it was 45 minutes before the scheduled departure time and there were still dozens of people waiting in line. Everyone was extremely anxious at this point because there was til the airport security line to get through. We arrived at the departure gate at 1:30 pm. Once onboard someone announced that the airline had decided to delay the departure so that all passengers could make the flight. Due to the delay, we missed our connecting flight to Seattle in DUblin. We arrived at gate #418 in Dublin, a gate agent was still present. She told us since we missed the flight we would have to go back to baggage claim, pick up our bags and proceed to a ticket counter to book another flight. She neglected to tell us we had to be escorted by an Aer Lingus employee to baggage claim. After about 30 minutes of looking for some help we finally met a very helpful woman named Loraine. She was kind enough to escort us and others in the same predicament to baggage claim. After retrieving our bags we went to the Aer Lingus “Ticket Assistance” counter. There a gentleman named Sean described our travel options, booked a flight for the following day and told us Aer Lingus would pay for a night in a local hotel as well as dinner. When we arrived at the Carlton Dublin Airport hotel, the people working the front desk told us the hotel was completely booked. When I asked if there were other hotels nearby I was told, “We’re a 4 star hotel, we only deal with other 4 star hotels and they’re all booked full as well”. We caught a ride back to the airport. When we arrived back at the Ticket Assistance counter and told our friend Sean what had happened he disappeared into a back office for a few minutes. When he returned he said, “Since all of our contracted hotels are booked, your only option is to obtain your own lodging and send us the receipt for reimbursement”. I called at least a dozen local hotels without success. By this time it was 6:30 pm and our flight to Seattle was scheduled to leave in 12 hours. We decided to spend the night in the terminal. To add insult to injury, when we arrived in Seattle my Daughter’s suitcase somehow failed to make the flight. We’re still waiting for it. I have been a professional pilot since 1987. This was by far my worst commercial airline travel experience ever."
Aer Lingus,✅Trip Verified| This is honestly one of the worst airlines to fly with. The boarding took forever to start. We were flying at 17:30 and we were already late boarding. This was the same for our flight from Dublin to Toronto. The food was absolutely garbage and the staff were not friendly at all.
Aero VIP,"✅Trip Verified| Cascais to Bragança with Aero VIP. Services are provided by SevenAir. The site is easy. I had a couple of questions and the support was fantastic. The plane was just fine, despite being a propeller, thus a bit noisy."
Aero VIP,"✅Trip Verified| Bragança to Cascais with Aero VIP. Seven Air provides the services. The pilot was very nice and made sure everyone was comfortable and explained there would be some turbulence, which was normal. Flight arrived 5 minutes late."
Aero VIP,"✅Verified Review|  Funchal to Porto Santo. This 10-minutes flight is a true experience. Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name. The outbound flight was on a vintage (1989) Jetstream 32 turboprop airliner with the return flight being on a slightly older (1987) Jetstream 31. In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board. The outbound flight left right on time and touched down in PXO just 10/15 minutes later. The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape. If you take this flight to reach the beaches in Porto Santo, as was my case, the whole flight is a really fun and unique retro-experience for aviation enthusiasts which unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag (150 EUR return). It needs to be said however, that the rates are much cheaper for residents who need this flight as a means to ensure territorial continuity."
Aerocaribbean,Havana - Cayo Coco return. A one hour flight with an old ATR42 turboprop. Seats surprisingly comfortable and we were offered a free drink plus candy onboard. Nothing special but we arrived on time.
Aerocaribbean,Holguin to Havana last week. Okay apart from issuing duplicate boarding cards to different passengers. Return was in a turbo prop plane which was 1 hour late and was infested by cockroaches running along the floor overhead lockers and electrical ducts. The plane was generally dirty. Obvious lack of maintenance.
Aerocaribbean,What a wonderful friendly airline. Flew with them Hholguin to Havana and back. Both flights only minor delays was served juice and a cake on this short internal flight safety demonstration was done.
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   I am at Sheremetyevo airport, currently living the bad experience. Yesterday, (19 September 2024) due to immigration line , I was 3 minutes late to boarding gate. I had a friend with me who begged them to let me come but they do not listen. My visa was was expiring on 19th. Aeroflot did not give me any assistance with missed flight. They just asked for money . I was all alone, finding about baggage, tickets and how to avoid overstay. Thankfully my brother booked another Aeroflot ticket (obviously overpriced) for 20th September from Chinese site. I did another check in and immigration at 11:54 , so avoided overstay. Now , I am at airport since 17 hours , and my flight is delayed. They announce ‘thanks for understanding’. If we should understand them, why can’t they understand us? They had time to throw out my luggage from plane, but no time for me to board it (plane gate was open, only boarding gate was closed in 3 minutes). There is no human angle and empathy involved with this airline, which leads to passengers being treated mechanically."
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Economy class SVO-IST B777-300ER Reg:RA73131 First of let me start by sharing the details I paid around 200$ for the ticket and it granted me 1 cabin baggage and 1 bag for the under seat i bought additional checked bag of 23kg max for around 50-55$. Seat selections were cheaper for the middle and more expensive for the window I paid 11$ for 34A.You could chose your meal before without any cost (latest 24hours prior to the flight) there was a lot of options but I chose not to chose and eat the standard meal given on the flight. It was the best flight i have ever had. Crew was super helpful greeted us at the beginning, were helping some passengers to put their luggage in the overhead bins. Blankets were handed when requested. The seats were comfortable had plenty of legroom my recommendation for the view is 34A or 34K because it will have two windows. Safety instructions were given as normal and we rocketed out of SVO Moscow. During the meal service turbulence occured and they had to stop it several times in the we got our food they had 3 choices for the breakfast I opted for an omlet (it was very good served with a small salad, salami, butter, jam, croissant and a bar of chocolate with and aeroflot a350 picture on its packaging) whereas there was also Russian pancake “blincikhi” with raspberry available and a müsli kind of option. Because of the turbulence only cold drinks were served during that period but hot drinks were available with a request (this was announced several times by the crew). There was 1 meal service and 3 service of drinks. Lavatories were clean nothing special. Inflight Entertainment was OK and they were also an Aeroflot magazine and a duty free catalogue. We departed 10 Minutes late from scheduled arrived 25 Minutes early. Crew made sure everyone had a nice flight. They saw us off as wishing the best and hoping meet again in future. I can surely say that they were happy with us being on that plane they were doing their job amazing. Thanks for the flight Aeroflot hope to meet again:)"
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I bought roundtrip and return tickets from Istanbul to Murmansk via Moscow from Aeroflot. Because of the late flight from Istanbul to Moscow, I could not reach the boarding time of my flight to Murmansk by 1 minute. The flight attendants were rude and unhelpful. There was nothing I could contact. I somehow reached my friend in Moscow, bought new tickets and went to Murmansk. My return ticket time was 01.01.2024. While trying to check in for return tickets on 31.12.2O23, I learned that Aeroflot automatically canceled these tickets. Again, I did not receive any notification message. In christmas time, i had to find and buy new tickets to come back my country with so expensive fee. I several times called Aeroflot, and write claim emails. I didn't receive any feedback, and support, help. It is very bad company. It is very bad service. I don't advise this company to everyone. They did not refund the cost of the tickets I could not use because of Aeroflot. Round trip and return tickets are independent of each other. This company cannot automatically cancel them this way. If so, he/she must inform us and pay for the tickets we have not used. I am still waiting information and payment from Aeroflot. I had very terrible experience with Aeroflot."
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I am shocked at how far Aeroflot standards have fallen since they invaded Ukraine, and this flight was a clear indicator of how much this airline is struggling to stay in the air. The ground service at Sheremetyevo Airport was dreadful, rude staff at Aeroflot counters / lounge and of course security and immigration gets worse by the day. Naturally I was very concerned about the safety of Aeroflot nowadays as they cannot legally get parts for most aircraft, but we got here. Food that used to be quite good was abysmal, inflight entertainment is very poor, and cabin staff seemed totally disinterested and presumably wanted to get a day or so on the Dubai beaches rather than do any work. Certainly recommend to avoid and I have re-booked my return on Turkish Airlines to have some better reassurance of safety. Avoid Aeroflot completely."
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  No way to get a refund. My flight was cancelled three times in 2020 and back then the company refused to refund, instead they issued a coupon that had a refund option after three years. And now when the time has come they tell me that because I'm a foreigner I can only get my refund in their office in Russia, Kazakhstan or China I do not recommend anyone to fly with this company ever."
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  I had booked a flight from Greece to Cuba. Due to COVID it was cancelled. I accepted a voucher to travel later. Then came the war and there are no flights over Europe. I asked for my refund and the reply was that I have to travel to Russia to receive my refund from Russian territory by myself. No other options. I didn't have to visit Russia to book my ticket.
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  Has your flight been cancelled by Aeroflot themselves? Forget about your money back. You will never see them. I'm waiting for a refund for last 2.5 years!
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no."
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"Not Verified|  Best airline in Russia! Very nice staff, comfortable seats (I don't ask much, I mean this is coming from a girl who drives tanks), good service and power supplies, anything you can possibly ask for, enough room for my single bag, and even more room. Great service, good crew, wonderful meals, and so much more!! Ground service, I was pushed around a lot, but that isn't the staffs' fault. I don't remember turning on my in-flight entertainment system, I was too busy playing World of Tanks Blitz with the incredible WiFi."
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I was very impressed with the staff. Many thanks to the Aeroflot representative Nina at Larnaca, who was extremely professional, friendly and genuinely caring for her passengers. The cabin crew were outstanding as well, especially the flight attendant Asiya and the purser Irina. They did everything to make people onboard happy."
AeroItalia,"✅Trip Verified|  Terrible airline. Avoid at all costs. My wife & I had a Palermo-to-Rome flight booked, and when the flight was less than 24 hours out, we attempted to check in using AeroItalia’s phone app and their web page. Neither would allow us to check in. We attempted many times all the way up to 2 hours before the flight with no success. We kept getting an error. Consequently, we were forced to check in at the check-in counter. The AeroItalia employee at the check-in counter insisted that we pay 70 Euros to check in. When we explained that we attempted many times to check in via phone and web page, but were not allowed to, she had zero sympathy and insisted on the 70 Euro payment. Clearly, this company is unscrupulous and is scamming their customers. There was another couple that we met in the line who had the exact same poor experience. So again, avoid AeroItalia at all costs. Fly ITA Airways instead. Even if you have to pay a little bit more. My experience with them was flawless."
AeroItalia,"✅Trip Verified| Absolute crooks. Had a flight from Ancona to Rome on December 3, 2023. Flight was postponed 6 times in three hours and then cancelled! Had to organize a taxi to Rome, cost a fortune, and missed my connecting flight. Waiting for my refund ever since! Now they don't even answer my emails anymore."
AeroItalia,✅Trip Verified|  Only 1 check-in desk open for a full plane and impossible to check in online. Amazingly bad! Flight crew is friendly. Pilot flying into Milano on April 1st did a very bad landing.
Aerolineas Argentinas,"Not Verified|  This review is in regards to the cabin crew for our flight AR 1383 on August 20, 2024 from Montevideo to Buenos Aires. They always offer beverages and sandwiches or muffins in Premium Class The staff closed the curtain and started to eat and drink. They did not offer even a glass of water. The got the sandwiches that were supposed to be offered to u."
Aerolineas Argentinas,"✅Trip Verified|   Terrible customer service Aerolineas Argentina has the worst customer service. On my flight from Brazil (Rio) to Argentina (El Calafate) they lost my luggage. Now I understand this can happen. At first, they worked very hard to find it, but it took them almost 3 days to find my luggage and send it to my hotel. In the meantime, I had some excursions planned and needed to purchase some basic clothing which was all in my luggage. During the process of filling in all the forms for getting my luggage back they told me all expenses I had to make will be reimbursed. So, when I got home after my vacation, I filled in a online form with all the details they provided me. After a month or so they just sent me an email (to which you cannot reply) that my luggage was delivered, and they didn’t want to reimburse my expenses. There is no phone number you can call or email address you can mail. Only one with a Spanish speaking computer. No real person to get in touch with. Again. I understand that sometimes mistakes are made, and luggage will get lost. But not providing any service and support to get my expenses back is in my opinion not done and not a SkyTeam member worthy."
Aerolineas Argentinas,"✅Trip Verified|  On June 7, I paid E-Dreams U$S 1,787.47 x Aerolíneas Argentinas ticket + E-Dreams commission U$S 166.53. The ticket was JFK-AEP-MVD with return MVD-AEP-JFK. A few months ago we were contacted by E-Dreams saying that this flight was not being made, and that they offered JFK-EZE-AEP-MVD with return MVD-AEP-EZE-JFK. We were presented with the option of a 100% refund for changing flights, we opted for a refund. At the same time, the same thing happened to a second person who was traveling the same route, but he made his purchase through Expedia, and they refunded his money within 72 hours. Until today, 12/14/23, I am trying to get my money back, I have called E-Dreams countless times, they say that Aerolíneas Argentinas does not answer their emails or calls. For my part, I have tried to call Aerolíneas Argentinas and they do not answer any phone. To add more, my wife went to the Aerolíneas Argentinas offices here in Montevideo, and they told her that she couldn't do anything, I went too and the same thing happened to me. Aerolíneas Argentinas fails to comply with the flight and does not say how to proceed or facilitate a refund, they pass the blame on to E-Dreams."
Aerolineas Argentinas,"✅Trip Verified|  Flew AR on various segments in November - Rio de Janeiro (GIG) to Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires - Puerto Madryn (r/t) and Buenos Aires - Barilcohe (r/t), using both AEP and EZE in Buenos Aires. Pleasant experience on all flights. All flights departed on time, boarding process was well organized, crews were courteous, and complimentary drinks and a snack were served in economy. No issues with checked luggage. Would certainly fly them again."
Aerolineas Argentinas,"Not Verified|  Flying from AEP to IGU in Prem Economy. I was nervous about what to expect on Aerolineas I have to say that I was really pleasantly surprised (once we got on the plane). Check in at Business was a breeze. Security and Boarding was polite chaos. They had two flights going to two locations boarding at the same gate at the same time. However the premium economy was great, simple but worth the extra. The seats were comfortable and clean (think that armchair type of seats you use to get in business class). Service on this flight was friendly (on others it was non-existant). They provided a sandwich and soft drinks. The best thing though is on every Aerolineas flight my bags were on the carousel as I arrived there. They have some amazing expedited system to get premium bags off which is great."
Aerolineas Argentinas,"Not Verified|  Our recent trip with Aerolineas Argentinas on the 6th, 7th and 11th was a deeply disappointing experience. Both on the way there and on the way back, we faced a series of problems that negatively affected our trip. On the way out, our scheduled flight to Buenos Aires from Guarulhos was scheduled to take off at 10:50 am. However, we were abruptly informed of a delay with no clear guidance on how to proceed. During the agonizing wait time, we received conflicting information about departure times, and promises of meal vouchers were not fulfilled on time. This forced us to spend our own money on food. To make matters worse, our flight was ultimately cancelled, and we faced difficulties in reaching Aerolineas employees for clear information. After an exhausting wait, we finally received a voucher for a hotel. However, the instructions for finding the bus to the hotel were confusing, and company staff seemed to be disrespectful of our situation.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we discovered that Aerolineas Argentinas had only paid for the outward ticket, leaving us with unexpected expenses for the return to the airport. The following night, we faced another long queue at the airport and missed our connection to El Calafate, without any hotel paid for by the company. We were instructed to request accommodation at a hotel in Buenos Aires, but were only given a voucher for breakfast at the airport. This resulted in an extra 10 hours of waiting at the airport, putting a damper on our planned tour. On the return trip, we faced an additional problem, as the stopover in Córdoba was not informed on the ticket, resulting in a 1-hour delay upon arrival in São Paulo. In short, our experience with Aerolineas Argentinas was highly unsatisfactory due to delays, cancellations, lack of clear communication and inadequate support from the company. We do not recommend choosing this airline for future travel.  Nossa recente viagem com a Aerolineas Argentinas nos dias 6, 7 e 11 foi uma experiência profundamente decepcionante. Tanto na ida quanto na volta, enfrentamos uma série de problemas que afetaram negativamente nossa viagem. Na ida, nosso voo programado para Buenos Aires a partir de Guarulhos estava marcado para decolar às 10h50. No entanto, fomos informados abruptamente de um atraso sem orientações claras sobre como proceder. Durante o tempo de espera angustiante, recebemos informações conflitantes sobre o horário de partida, e promessas de vouchers para refeições não foram cumpridas a tempo. Isso nos obrigou a gastar nosso próprio dinheiro para alimentação. Para piorar, nosso voo foi finalmente cancelado, e enfrentamos dificuldades para encontrar funcionários da Aerolineas para obter informações claras. Depois de uma espera exaustiva, finalmente recebemos um voucher para um hotel. No entanto, as instruções para encontrar o ônibus para o hotel foram confusas, e funcionários da companhia pareciam desrespeitar nossa situação.  Ao chegar ao hotel, descobrimos que a Aerolineas Argentinas havia pago apenas a passagem de ida, deixando-nos com despesas inesperadas para a volta ao aeroporto. Na noite seguinte, enfrentamos outra fila longa no aeroporto e perdemos nossa conexão para El Calafate, sem nenhum hotel pago pela companhia. Fomos instruídos a solicitar alocação em um hotel em Buenos Aires, mas recebemos apenas um voucher para café da manhã no aeroporto. Isso resultou em 10 horas extras de espera no aeroporto, prejudicando nosso passeio planejado. Na viagem de volta, enfrentamos um problema adicional, já que a escala em Córdoba não estava informada na passagem, resultando em um atraso de 1 hora na chegada a São Paulo. Resumindo, nossa experiência com a Aerolineas Argentinas foi altamente insatisfatória devido a atrasos, cancelamentos, falta de comunicação clara e apoio inadequado da companhia. Não recomendamos a escolha desta companhia aérea para futuras viagens."
Aerolineas Argentinas,"An hour delay, no apologies nor explanations. Quite some occasional turbulences, again no word from the cockpit. What compensated the whole flight was the incredible good seat pitch and the round of drinks and a cookie (definitely much better than what some self-proclaimed full-service airlines deliver)."
Aerolineas Argentinas,Not Verified|  Do Not Fly! They will take your money and not refund you. They moved my flight up two hours but sent me an email saying that it was changed to the next day. I called the next day to confirm and they said that it was an error but I would have to still pay for a new flight because I missed the original one that they messed up on. Please please please do not lose your money with them.
Aerolineas Argentinas,Not Verified| It was an international flight and I received lousy food in bad condition. It's unbelievable that they don't offer a minimum service when the tickets are so expensive. Never again!
Aerolineas Argentinas,"Not Verified|  Non-existent catering, lousy coffee, a glass of water in plastic elements, non-existent entertainment, and aircraft without USB chargers.  The chaotic checkin, and staff with rude appearances. El catering inexistente, un cafe malísimo, un vaso de agua en elementos de plástico, entretenimiento inexistente, y las aeronaves sin cargadores de USB. El chekin caotico, y personal con unas apariencias maleducados"
Aeromar,"✅Trip Verified|  Guadalajara to Puerto Vallarta. Never again will I fly with this airline! The plane was so small and super hot inside. My seatbelt didn’t work as they are supposed too. Cabin staff just don’t care for customers! Just a horrible airline, never again will I use it."
Aeromar,"✅Trip Verified|  Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara. Scheduled for 17:15, first delay 18:00, then 18:30, then 18:50. No staff and no explanation. Now the screen reads Viva aerobus to Puebla at 19:00. Still no staff and still no explanation. I will never use this airline again."
Aeromar,"✅Trip Verified|  Puerto Escondido to Mexico City. Aeromar is usually my airline of choice. On this day they were more than 2 hours late. So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto. There it is guys, the reason why I might never fly with Aeromar again."
Aeromar,✅Trip Verified|  Oaxaca to Mexico City . I have never experienced such bad customer service. People had been in line for over 2 hours. Only 1 desk agent. Instead of calling people up front for the flight that was going to depart he checked in people for the flight after. Then gave us boarding tickets when the plane was already gone. People waited for 2 hours to find out what to do next. This airline is a joke! We got booked on a flight the next morning resulting in a loss of paid hotel in Mexico city. When we arrived the next morning there were again 50 angry people in line waiting for a flight that Aeromar cancelled and didn't tell anyone. When we finally got on the plane multiple people had the same seat number. It was ridiculous and unprofessional.
Aeromar,"✅Trip Verified|  I paid $365 for a direct flight from Oaxaca to Tuxtla Gutierrez in Mexico. This airlines baited and switched me by canceling the direct flight and they changed the ticket to Aeromexico with connecting flights and a longer trip that I can now by for $158. They would not refund the flight and i unfortunately booked it with Priceline (who has the worst customer service in the known universe), so I received no assistance whatsoever and options that were not properly explained to me. When I phoned Aeromar, I was greeted by a completely rude agent who was less than helpful. I would strongly advise against booking anything with this airlines."
Aeromar,"✅Trip Verified|  Ixtapa Zihuatanejo to Acapulco via Mexico City. My 17-yr old daughter had the misfortune to come in contact with Aeromar and the lack of services while she was on route to Acapulco, on December 23, 2017. She had two connecting flights with Aeromar Airlinesone which was delayed and caused her to missed her final flight to Acapulco. The flight that was delayed was Flight 522. This flight from Ixtapa, to Mexico City was delayed fourty minutes and therefore, she arrived late to her gate to board flight 907, to her final destination, which was Acapulco. She was denied boarding, and there was no help from anyone from Aeromar, after whoch was not permitted to board. My 17-yr old, started her holidays stranded in a foreign country, in a busy airport and just left to her demise. I tried contacting the airline, no one answered, I contact which tried to get in touch with costumer service, and the booking agent, was not able as well. What is disgusting, is that not a single of the airline personnel working that night, offered to help, my daughter was just turned away and you did not care, specially, since it was the airline's fault in the first place that she missed her flight. My daughter had a panic attack, was afraid, and I had to sort all this out from Canada. To my misfortune, I had to buy, yet another ticket from Aeromar, for the next day, as well as find accommodations for the night. The travel agency which helped me book this trip, has made numerous attempts to resolve this, and nothing has been resolved yet."
Aeromar,"✅Trip Verified|  Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo to Mexico City. Once more a delayed flight, just three hours but without any guarantee. Just ""we hope that more or less at 4pm we will have a plane"". Incompetent and unfriendly staff, truly the bad side of Mexico, just the image the country does not want to give. Everybody here gives you the impression that they want you out of their face and expect you to be thankful that there might be a flight after all. Which is not yet secured."
Aeromar,Puerto Escondido to Mexico City on Aeromar. Small plane and we left about 30 minutes late. Plane was not full and just one stewardess working the flight. The plane appeared to be new. It was in excellent condition in the cabin. Service was excellent but it was very expensive for a flight of less the two hours.
Aeromar,"Fly 10 or 12 times a year Mexico City to Ciudad Victoria. Planes are small Fokker Turboprops. Always very friendly staff and have been on time. Seats are rather small, an excellent lounge with drinks and snacks at a number of airports. Service onboard with snacks and drinks are adequate."
Aeromexico,"Not Verified| Aeromexico states that travelers in business class (aka Premier Class) can preselect meals. This is only true for flights departing Mexico City. The airline also states that passengers with special dietary needs can reserve a special meal regardless of their point of departure. This is only partially true. For example, special meals such as diabetic meals can only be ordered for flights longer than 9 hours. That seems rather ridiculous. If Aeromexico were really interested in accommodating passengers wants and needs, it would allow the meal selection on all its flights, especially for passengers who have dietary restrictions."
Aeromexico,"✅Trip Verified|   Worst airline I had to deal with, yet. My flight has been cancelled, the proposed replacement was just ridiculous. I asked for a refund, but never received it. Their customer service is as bad as the airline itself. Except for some standard blurbs, asking you to wait for some mysterious reason, nothing else comes from them. My first, and for sure last time I bought a flight with them."
Aeromexico,"✅Trip Verified|   The first and last time I’ll fly this absolute garbage excuse for an airline. I had a flight departing from MEX at 9:50 so just to be safe I arrived at the airport at 7am. Checked my bag and proceeded to wait around for nearly 2 hours for them to display a gate. I go to my gate to make sure I know where it is and then I head to a lounge so I can sit for a bit when I suddenly get a notification that the flight is now 10 mins delayed on the AMX 2.0 app. So I think, ok, the flight is leaving at 10 now, I’ll go to the gate at 9:30 and when I arrive they tell me there’s no delay and we closed the gate already. They literally let someone in right in front of me and told me “no, doors closed 5 mins ago and the list was already send.” So, you’re telling me you’re going to send a notification that the flight is delayed and now departs at 10am and then proceed to close the doors 40 mins before this new departure time? The employees at the gate looked inconvenienced that I was even asking them questions, they call over air control and he tells me they can offer me food vouchers and put me on the next flight that leaves 7 hours later. “Sorry, the app doesn’t work sometimes.” Are you kidding me?! I’ve been a frequent flyer for over a decade, and I’ve never experienced anything like this before. The hate I have for this airline is palpable"
Aeromexico,✅Trip Verified|   Boarding was done efficiently by zones with nobody trying to push in. The aircraft was a brand new 737-900 max and it looked pristine. The PE seats were comfortable with sufficient pitch. It was a short flight and we were offered a choice of soft drinks or beer. Each seat had its own screen and the aircraft was equipped with wifi. The cabin crew were pleasant and efficient. The aircraft seemed remarkably quiet and both takeoff and landing were smooth. Overall the flight ticked every box.
Aeromexico,"Not Verified| Aeromexico is the worst I have seen in Service Dog policy (not Emotional Support Animals). If your disability is not apparent they will treat you and your service dog like a passenger traveling with a pet. They have no respect for the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and they will not have respect for you. My experience with them is based on a flight I bought from a US airline's website from Los Angeles to Mexico but the US airlines was partnered with Aeromexico. In the end I was not allowed to board on the Aeromexico flight due to documentation they asked (my service dog's health certificate), which is not required by the Mexican government for any cat or dog traveling to Mexico from the US. It is important to know that though passengers purchase a flight with a US airline and your US flight is partnered with Aeromexico they will not respect the service dog policy your US airline abides by and Aeromexico will ignore the approval of documentation the US flight provides you. Aeromexico will ask for your service dog documents again, as if you bought a flight from them, and make you believe it is a Mexican government requirement. In speaking with Mexican government officials responsible for inspecting animals arriving from all over the world, they were surprised Aeromexico goes to the extent of not allowing passengers on a flight without a health certificate when they don't even require it from US visitors with service dogs and/or cats or dogs to Mexico. My thought is why not just simply state on their website, ""As Aeromexico we do not abide by ADA regulation and we do not accept any animal, service dog or not, to fly with us from the US to Mexico without a health certificate."" This statement would be a whole lot clearer to US airlines partnering with them, and save time of US flights making you go through all the process of uploading documents to approve your service dog on the flight-which Aeromexico won't respect anyway-and passengers with service dogs will not even think twice of purchasing a flight with them to Mexico."
Aeromexico,"✅Trip Verified| Flew MEX-OAX round trip in business. Quick and friendly check-in both ways, with access to Aeromexico’s Salon Premier at MEX. The lounge was busy but I got a seat and had a decent breakfast. Again, staff super friendly. Flights both ways were on time and, despite a flight time of just 40 mins, the cabin crew managed to serve a pastry and coffee en route. WiFi worked perfectly. I’d fly with Aeroméxico again."
Aeromexico,"✅Trip Verified|  I must clarify that I have never actually set foot on an Aeromexico flight -- they denied me travel using the ticket that I have successfully paid for through their own website. This is all due to their poorly communicated and disastrously (un)documented ""payment validation policy"", the details of which I will explain below. Soon after purchasing my ticket, I received an email stating that my ""reservation...[is] subject to validation of the payment method"" by showing the original form of payment. Admittedly, the email is appropriately titled ""IMPORTANT NOTICE"", but the lack of any indication of the possibilities for such a ""payment validation"" PRIOR to payment was already a failure. Of course, I did not have the original form of payment (a physical credit card) with me, but the email NEVER described the repercussions for failing to present it (ie. being denied boarding). Furthermore, the email lacked emphasis on the specific requirement for the original credit card (rather than any credit card) just worsened Aeromexico's ineptitude in communication. This is especially problematic given that I (and I believe the vast majority of travellers) had never encountered the requirement for payment validation, and even Googling in hindsight does not yield meaningful results, including from Aeromexico itself. Upon discovering such an issue at check-in, it was crystal clear that Aeromexico also completely refuses to recognize and provide solutions for almost inevitable issues resulting from their vague communication and lack of transparency. After being informed that I cannot use the ticket under my very own name and ""successfully paid for"" (their words), I suggested using another credit card to pay for the ticket again. This was simply repeatedly denied with ""the system is unable to do so"". Then, I suggested simply replacing my originally purchased ticket with a completely new one that I will purchase on the spot. However, the ticket was deemed unable to be cancelled and also unable to be replaced with a new ticket in its place with no specific reasoning. Lastly, I requested Aeromexico's ticketing staff (rather than check-in staff) to be contacted about this issue, but this was again denied, and I then had to personally discuss the issue with Aeromexico's call center, to no avail. At a more foundational level, the existence of payment validation in the first place is already incomprehensible. Their OWN website, through which I completed the payment, has already verified the credit card using 2-factor authentication. Ultimately, this whole matter just seems like a moronic excuse for deeper issues within Aeromexico's operatios, such as overbooking their flights (one reasoning for denying me repurchasing the ticket was that the flight was 100% full). At least the refund was claimed to be automatic and to the original form of payment, but this was the bare minimum of their obligations given such a despicable, arbitrary demand before a passenger who booked the flight 11 days in advance can use their very own ticket. Of course, I cannot discuss the other aspects of Aeromexico due to being forced to have never been on their flights. Nevertheless, I feel confident in suggesting everyone else to avoid Aeromexico for their potential of whatever other unfaithful practice."
Aeromexico,"✅Trip Verified| A TOTAL NIGHTMARE! I was trying to book a flight for me and my son with Aeromexico, so I did select the dates, and the itinerary after submitting my payment information the website failed to load and I got a yellow message saying ""Oops something went wrong, please try again."", so I FOLLOWED the instructions I got from the website thinking ""well, probably this credit card rejected the transaction"", so I did try once more planning to use a different credit card when I was at the point to book the flight I noticed that the morning scheduled I wanted wasn't available anymore for the date I previously selected so I thought: ""well, maybe THIS is the reason why the page failed to load a few minutes ago, this flight is no longer available"", so I continued with the process and I tried to pull up the calendar for the day before to see if that morning schedule was available and indeed it was, so I selected this flight for the day before I had previously selected on the failed transaction. So I filled out all my personal info along with a different credit card's information just in case and this time, the transaction was completed correctly! so I went straight forward to my email to check the summary of the purchase and BOOM! I found there were two email confirmations with 2 different itineraries! Aeromexico CHARGED ME for the first transaction that didn't go through even though I got an error message on the website during the payment process!! Aeromexico charged me for that first transaction and of course for the second one that went through correctly but the problem is that they CHARGED ME TWICE FOR A FLIGHT FOR THE SAME 2 PEOPLE! I've been calling them, submitting tickets, and numerous Emails and they have ZERO EMPATHY! they keep on saying that was my fault that the website failed and they can do NOTHING FOR ME because that error wasn't their fault, they could help me for ""duplicity"" but the dates don't match, so my issue won't be considered duplicity therefore there's nothing they can do to help me. I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY to explain that it WAS NOT a duplicity issue, the website failed and even though I got the error message it charged me without me noticing! I've been dealing with this for almost 10 days already and at this point, they are just ignoring my Emails, they are closing my tickets without even responding to any of them when I call they say that I could get a reimbursement but a ticket should be submitted and when I submit the ticket these agents immediately close them without giving me a reason or anything! They don't respond to my messages anymore. THE WORST PART OF THIS is that I decided to book with Aeromexico because my original plan was to book with Volaris but some friends told me that it wasn't a good idea to go with them, instead, they said I could book with Aeromexico which was more secure and comfy so I followed their advice and I've canceled my flight with VOLARIS the very same day I booked it and within 3 business days, THEY GAVE ME A FULL REFUND FOR MY PURCHASE!!!! WITHIN 3 BUSINESS DAYS!!!! and here I'm still begging for mercy with Aeromexico so they can put on my shoes, have a little empathy, and understand what I'm trying to say so I can get my money back but nobody seems to listen/pay attention to what I'm saying, zero customer service, zero empathy, no sense of urgency NOTHING! With the responses they have given"
Aeromexico,"Not Verified| Avoid this company, don’t make the mistake buying a ticket because it may be cheaper. 11 PM - First they delayed the flight 2 hours, then just no information, I’m there at the airport with husband and 2 kids, no compensation, no drinks, nothing. Just waiting and waiting. Then at 2 AM they said the flight is cancelled because the ""cabin crew"" didn’t show up and announced a new flight for the next day at 6 PM. They dont want to give us more information, and no compensation at all. Let's see if we really get into the 6 pm flight."
Aeromexico,"Not Verified|   I have no complaints, especially since I’ve usually had to fly American out of the worn-out Terminal 1. But aside, I found the staff at MEX to be polite and professional; and English-speaking though I used Spanish. The in-flight amenities were quite good, with a light meal served to Economy passengers both ways on this flight. And again after usually flying American out of this airport I appreciated especially the seatback IFE system. Needless to say for my flights to ORD out of MEX Aeromexico will be my go-to."
Aerosur,Shanghai to Tehran return July 2012. Direct flight to Tehran. Economy class. Aircraft A310. Fare was quite good. Check-in fast. Cabin crew showed Iranian hospitality. No individual inflight entertainment but fairly speaking since the flight was at night. One toilet closed for whole trip the other two were not clean and almost out of tissue. Food was enough and fine for me. Many drink options. Flying time was less than 10 hours on my way to Tehran and less than 8 on the way back to Shanghai. Considering all the above I will certainly choose this airline next time for my trip to Tehran.
Aerosur,DXB-IKA. A300-600 aircraft clean cabin with friendly flight attendants variety of meals were good but the quality of meal was very poor.
Aerosur,Madrid - Santa Cruz B747-400 economy. Checked in at Palma okay on connection but no through booking for seats. Check in at Madrid and Aerosur cabin luggage allowance less than originating airline (through ticket) so cabin bag removed and put in hold. Entering plane strong toilet odour throughout the cabin. Generally a very dirty cabin interior with hard uncomfortable seating. No inflight films available. Bar service once glass of wine and water. Cabin staff said they had run out. Dinner was a greasy stodgy rice. I've got my return to look forward to - and all for £1450.00 return. Awful - I do this trip 3 times a year and nobody else treats passengers like this.
Aerosur,Santa Cruz to La Paz. The flight we were booked on was cancelled two days in advance and we were switched to a later flight. This flight was then delayed by over an hour and there was no information given as to how long the delay would be - the aircraft just didn't turn up. Once finally on board no acknowledgement of the delay but otherwise ok - a small sandwich and drink were served which was fine for such a short flight. The aircraft was quite old although not as old as some others we saw - they still use 727s for some flights.
Aerosur,Zero: contact their reservation/sales desk by sending 7 emails in Spanish and English. To this day I never received any reply of any kind. Still don't have my reservation code so still unsure if my reservation exist. Have not travelled yet so can not rate on board experience.
Aerosur,Buenos Aires to Miami with a delay in the output of Buenos Aires 5hrs. After a scheduled stopover in Santa Cruz in Bolivia suffered a further delay of 4 hours. In addition to this as the plane that took us up was very small for the flight he was forced to make an additional stop to fuel in Cali Colombia. The planes we had to take us to get to Miami were dirty with broken seats no kind of entertainment (such as TV). The poor and inattentive staff of course had to deal with few resources. The return flight similar. Delays old planes but most of the journey by plane Miami-Santa Cruz had a noise in your engine that was intolerable to the ears. Large number of passengers frightened by the strange sound was heard constantly.
Aerosur,Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and don't mind delayed flights changed schedules and don't mind having confirmed tickets ignored.
Aerosur,Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil - a saving of about $50US over GOL. At the airport check-in was easy. I recommend that you arrive early to avoid the impending line. The counter staff was as friendly and they did not charge me for my extra luggage weight. I was impressed by the 737 that AeroSur is using on this international flight [do note that most AeroSur flights use aging 727s]. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on this two hours flight and we arrived on time. .
Aerosur,La Paz - Sucre in an ex-Mexicana 727. Ticketing process is manual and very slow - beware and get your tickets before the airport! We were handed a little snack bag as we boarded then served drinks on board - a great way to provide good service on a short flight.
Aerosur,Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil. At the airport check-in was easy. It pays to arrive early and avoid the impending line. The counter staff was friendly and they did not charge me for my extra weight (about 4 kilos). I was impressed by the new 737 that Aerosur used on this leg - most AeroSur flights use older 727. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on a 2 hours flight and we arrived on time. I would use them again for this route.
Africa World Airlines,"Not Verified| They have to be more customer-centric rather than themself. I flew from Lagos to Accra by AWA and lamented from where I entered for checking. Ground staff kept asking to pay money, and most of them did so. It begins with weighing the baggage to the porters, to the ground staff over there, then to the counter while collecting my boarding pass, to the person who will transfer my luggage to the transfer belt, and many others. Also, when I paid 1 staff and not the 2nd one, They started saying I was not a good man, stingy, and many other things which made me feel like that is it a professional airline or the other way around. They are not ashamed of their act that also in front of their seniors and surprisingly they also keep mum. I felt like falling victim to their demands and ended up paying more than 5 staff. That two hrs I spent to do checking was terrible and turned horrible. I was traveling with extra luggage and paid a handsome amount for the extra luggage which is an additional income for the airlines and this kind of treatment I received. It's a SAD and disappointing. I have boycotted AWA and will encourage my friends and family and all known persons to me, to boycott this airline who don't care for their regular customers. In one word It's pathetic."
Africa World Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Africa World Airlines is unclean, unsafe, unpunctual and unconcerned. My premium economy flight from Kumasi to Accra was delayed by 2 hours after checking in but nobody from the airline told us any reason. All the passengers were crowded into a small area with no social distancing as if there was no pandemic happening. When we finally boarded the flight, the hostess was constantly removing her nose mask to flirt with some politician in the front seat. I asked her for a cup of coffee and was refused because she said only water is allowed due to COVID. For the extra price that we are paying for premium economy and the number of hours that they hold us hostage we deserve better! The seat was dirty and the armrest plastic was chipped, while the signs on the ancient noisy plane were all in Chinese. You could feel the plane shaking the whole time during the flight which makes you wonder if they even do proper maintenance. We finally reached our destination nearly 3 hours late but my baggage did not arrive. There were people from earlier flights also waiting there for their bags so this seems to be a very common thing. The airport staff were rude and told us to wait and maybe our bags would come, maybe not. I wound up missing my flight on Turkish Airlines while waiting for the bag and had to pay for a hotel and to get a new PCR test to travel the next day. I will never fly with this airline again even if it was the last airline in the world and nor will I allow my loved ones to risk their lives. Next time I will just take the VIP bus from Kumasi to ensure I arrive in comfort and punctuality."
Africa World Airlines,"Not Verified|  Needs to hold itself accountable for their actions. Arrived at our destination only to realize about 99% of passenger's luggage was not on the flight. Only one passenger had her luggage, how was this even possible? Had to wait for about 2 hours more without any form of compensation. What was even more annoying was the fact that they didn't seem to care much about it as many clients were frustrated with the situation. They need serious competition from another domestic airline in Ghana."
Africa World Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  AWA needs to be held accountable for their bad service. They have never been on time ever in all the times that I have flown on their planes. The planes are small and old and dirty and staffs are rude and arrogant. It is normal for your flight to be two or three hours delayed every time. But if you come even one minute late for checking in they will sell your seat to another person and make you buy it again. During the flight they used to give sandwiches and pastries and juices but now only water is given for flights of almost one hour. Also during the Covid times they are not maintaining any social distancing on the plane.
Africa World Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Africa World Airlines is the worst airline in the world.  I was supposed to fly from Lagos to Accra on the 3rd of September, but my flight was cancelled without notice. I tried to travel again on the 7th of September but this was also cancelled. They have no office in Lagos so I had to drive all the way to the airport every day, only to find that they were closed. I was finally able to book my flight after paying 20,000 Naira to one of the airport workers who knew someone who worked there. They also require you to pay 50,000 Naira to take an expensive Covid test before they allow you to board their flights. When I reached the airport for travel, they refused to check me in because I was wearing a face shield instead of a mask and they made me pay extra to buy a mask from one of the airport shops. Then when we arrived in Ghana, they charged me another £120 to take another test at the airport there. Why can't they just charge one single price for their services instead of advertising one price and then trying to squeeze more money out of their poor customers? The Covid tests should also be free for their passengers instead of trying to make even more profit from us who are struggling with reduced income in the pandemic. I will never fly with this airline again."
Africa World Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Accra to Freetown. Terrible service. 4 hours before our scheduled flight and cancelled our flight. There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, ""do you have a place to stay here in Ghana?"" This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying ""Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!"". When we were never told of such thing at all. Overall, a frustrating experience and not looking to book with Africa World Airlines ever again. I would hope to be wrong and they improve, but the stress and risk of surprise cancellation are not worth entertaining the cheaper fare. I cannot comment on inflight experience because - well, I didn't fly with them."
Africa World Airlines,"Not Verified|  Accra to Kumasi. The flight was cancelled three times. I book the flight 2pm which was more expensive than travelling in the evening, but at long last I travel in evening which I don't like. And when I was coming was the same cancellation also three times cancellation"
Africa World Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Kumasi to Accra. Very bad service, my flight was delayed over 2hours and there was no communication from the staff as to the time we will board the flight. Neither did they show any sense of sympathy towards our being delayed. They completely ignored us knowing that there’s not much we can do. It mess up my business trip . I will surely not use this service again."
Africa World Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  
Tamale to Accra. Good onboard service, juice snack and a meat pastry. Thing that let it down was pre flight experience. Their online card payment system for the flight never works. It charged me twice for my flight and their customer service call centre is so shocking that after one month of trying they didn’t refund. Had to do a charge back through my card. They then cancelled my booking although I had still paid. They didn’t tell me they had cancelled it. I luckily checked my booking 2 hours before the flight."
Africa World Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Domestic flight Accra-Tamale. 1hr flight. One time in both directions. Water, juice and snack (fish or meat pie, savoury biscuits) provided on this short flight (more than you get on BA domestic/European flights three days). Friendly and very polite cabin crew. Marvellous captain who gave great information about the flight. Joint venture between Hainan Airlines (China), Hahn Airways and Ghanian investors. An excellent service which makes domestic travel much easier in Ghana"
Afriqiyah Airways,I bought the ticket in February to travel to Kinshasa in April - in March all flights were cancelled because of the conflict in Libya. I went to the travel agency to ask about what I should do - the answer was to wait until the end of the conflict. Agency was unable to rebook me or to transfer to other airlines. I am having difficulties to find their offices in London or contacts - can someone help. I have lost my money and time and no one to help.
Afriqiyah Airways,Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them. On the basis of value for money Afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference.
Afriqiyah Airways,I booked a flight to Lagos via Tripoli. We had delays at Gatwick but once in Tripoli we were told to wait two days for our connecting flight to Lagos which - totally unacceptable. We stayed in the airport from early Mon morning until monday evening stranded without any local currency and offered refreshments approx 11am. After a lot of protest we were put on flight approx 8pm that evening. This was my first experience with Afriqiyah and will be my last - despite the savings it wasn't worth the terrible experience. The lack of communication in Tripoli was disgraceful and =on the plane the staff were curt.
Afriqiyah Airways,BRU-JNB-BRU with a stopover in Tripoli. There were some troubles with the in-flight entertainment. On our way to JNB there were not enough headsets so we couldn't use the inflight entertainment. On our way back from JNB to Tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didn't work at all. The food was okay and the cabin crew friendly. It's definitely value for money but there are some things to improve.
Afriqiyah Airways,LGW-TIP-LGW on A320/A330. Both flights approx 1 hour delayed Servisair lounge at LGW basic and overcrowded quiet lounge in Tripoli. Uncrowded flights - very few pax in Business cabin. Comfortable seats for 3 hr journey but angled lie-flat seats on A330 too short for me (1.80m). Food tasty (no alcohol of course) limited but OK film choice on AVOD. FAs sweet but not all spoke english. Be aware Tripoli airport can be difficult to navigate as all signage in Arabic only!
Afriqiyah Airways,We flew to Johannesburg from London Gatwick via Tripoli to attend the World Cup. All flights near enough on time and a smooth transit through Tripoli. Tripoli airport is not too bad although I wouldn't like to spend more than a few hours there. The entertainment was good food as good as expected the were polite (but spoke little English) and the seats comfortable with sufficient leg room. I did get the impression that the staff were probably a little too laid back at times. Overall the value for money was excellent the customer service was good and the planes were modern (although they did need cleaning up a bit.)
Afriqiyah Airways,Firstly the take off was delayed with no announcements when we asked at the desk they just said 'we will go when we go'! Once on the plane we noticed it is empty so we had extra space but it looks like they failed to clean properly my table was covered in food smears when I asked for a wet towel to wipe it off I was told to 'just relax man just chill'! It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death & murder are all good! Tripoli Airport is awful you can barely breath for the smoke and there's no organisation it's like going back it time.
Afriqiyah Airways,London Gatwick - Tripoli - Accra return. Tripoli to Accra was delayed a little as only one scanner was working so when they started boarding about half the passengers were still on the wrong side of the security check. The other flights were on time. Food good seats comfy checked luggage was where it should be price was excellent. Having read previous comments here I had to see how bad the loos at Tripoli airport could be and was disappointed : clean and even soap in the dispenser!
Afriqiyah Airways,London -Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any I've travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline I've travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time!
Afriqiyah Airways,CDG-TIP-OUA out ABJ-TIP-CDG return. Excellent flight to TIP clean new A330 with good food and friendly staff. Flight to OUA similarly well presented. Unfortunately the flight from ABJ-TIP was operated by Nouvelair on Afriqiyah's behalf other passengers also noticed the difference with grumpy staff and terrible food. Happy to return to CDG with Afriqiyah again and more good service.
Aigle Azur,"✅Trip Verified| Just don't travel with this company. It's simply not worth it. It's not a trustful company. It was my first try with it, but they have already disappointed me. They cancelled my return flight Paris to Sao Paulo with a message saying only: ""your flight is cancelled. If you need to contact us, go to our webpage or call us on xxxx number (0,06 euros per minute)"". I tried to call immediately, and I didn't get any answer. I tried many times. Then I requested a refund through the online form and I'm waiting to see how much time they will take and how much they will actually refund once their policy says they do not refund services fees, which they put up the double price of the actual flight. My guess is that they do that very often to oblige costumers to fly with them when they want, or when they have enough passengers. They cancel your dates and then you will have to rebook your flight to another date which they will impose to you and which may be the one there are enough passengers. I won't do that though. I will get my refund, whatever they refund and never deal with them anymore."
Aigle Azur,"✅Trip Verified| Kiev to Paris. So, I bought tickets 1.5 months before the trip. Unfortunately, plans had changed, I had to cancel my trip. I also purchased insurance for cancellation with tickets. So a week before the flight, I wanted to cancel my tickets. I tried to call for 3 days in a row to their support line and every time I was listening to music for 10-15 minutes and getting billed for that (calling from abroad is quite expensive), but no one ever picked up the phone (during their official business hours). I sent multiple emails about my request - no reply. I tried to submit multiple requests via manage my booking on their website - but every time I tried to submit I got the ticket number with status closed right away and no ability to check it. So, in the end, I just lost my money and their insurance is worthless as nobody will ever get back to you. Do not recommend at all. First time seeing such big company who does not care about their customers at all. And their website has a lot of bugs as well. Find another company to flight with."
Aigle Azur,"✅Trip Verified|  I visit my parents regularly in Paris, I always use Air France, Transavia, or Middle east airlines. But today was the first and last flight with this Aigle Azur. On the passport my name is Ludovic while on the ticket its Ludwig. The family name is the same. So because of 3 letters difference, they want to charge 80 euros. Why changing 3 letters cost 80EUR? This is how you lose passengers."
Aigle Azur,"✅Trip Verified|  It was my first time flying with Aigle Azur. To be honest, I didn't choose it, but Hainan Airlines. To start with, we took off with more then 2 hours delay without notifications. It wasn't the airport issue, but the company problem, because we had to wait for the plane to arrived from Sao Polo. I will skip the on-board service. So we arrived with 2 hours delayed, and, with other customers, we have a connection flight to Shanghai. This second flight is Hainan Airlines. Obviously the flight didn't wait for us. No one to received us after landing to give instructions or anything. When we asked to change the connection flight ticket at Hainan counter, we are told ""Aigle Azur didn't confirmed the delay in your flight, so we can't change your flight ticket"". The company is late and didn't even assume its responsibility. As a result, we had to pay for an other flight ticket, Aigle Azur customer service doesn't even exist / isn't reachable. Worst airline I experienced, I should have considered to read the reviews about this airline first."
Aigle Azur,"✅Trip Verified|  Berlin to Paris. Flight on time, clean and modern plane. It was impossible to buy any drinks due to an issue with their visa machine. The crew was ok but they could smile a bit more. At Orly airport, we had to disembark by bus, which took 10 minutes to finally be at the south terminal."
Aigle Azur,✅Trip Verified|  Beirut to Paris. Worst experience ever! I booked online a two way ticket for a very tight scheduled business flight and after taking the money from my bank account a few days later i received a notification that the return flight was rescheduled to two days later which does not suite me although tickets offerings for the same date were still available on many sites online. A couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled. I was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund. Upon choosing the full refund I got back less than 40% of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable. The funniest thing is that the cancelled flight was charged much less than the outbound flight and this was the only amount subject to full refund. I never recommend Aigle Azur. I rate this act as a sort of phishing. They lie to you about cheap available flights and then reschedule it based on their interest so you will be the only and major loser for cancelling if the rescheduling does not suite you.
Aigle Azur,"✅Trip Verified|  Berlin to Paris Orly. Bought the ticket online a week ago and it was impossible to add a luggage. I connected on the official Website add my luggage for 25 eur, received a mail saying it was charged. Checked the morning of my flight and no luggage added, no money debited. Tried all morning to add a luggage on the bugged website. Declined, declined they it seemed to work since it displayed the total amount of the flight and the luggage of 25eur. To discover at check in that that did not work and that they would charge me the double. Not good. Second time with Aigle Azur and always an issue. Definitely the last time."
Aigle Azur,"Basel Mulhouse to Algiers on 19/03/206. It was scheduled for 14:50 and departed at 20:06, without any explanation, excuse or apology. The only representative the company had at the airport could not give any information, nor provide any help to the hundreds of passengers stuck at the airport. What is even worse is that the company has no customer service to contact, no telephone number and no email address. The only way to contact the company is through a form on their website to which you will never get any answer ever!"
Aigle Azur,Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!
Aigle Azur,Porto to Paris Orly on ZI 312 (A320) on 28 March 2014. First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid . Not sure if I'll have another chance to travel on them again but if they have routes that I want to fly I'll keep them in mind.
Air Algerie,"✅Trip Verified| Worst cross-ocean flight I ever had. Issues we had: - They lost our luggage - They do not offer to pay to deliver our luggage, and asked us to pay UPS to get it delivered to us. No facilities at all in Algiers Airport, hence terrible experience during connection. For our return trip, they changed our flight without a reason, and forced us to wait at Algiers Airport for 9 hours for a connection without giving a viable alternative."
Air Algerie,"✅Trip Verified| Almost no announcements in English during flight. Plane very dirty, like not cleaned for decades, decaying 737-600, couldn't eat the suspicious snack given. Online check-in is actually not available for Air Algérie flights, as you need to have your ticket printed in the old fashioned way. Staff were friendly and professional but can't make it better with the airline they're working to."
Air Algerie,"✅Trip Verified|  The most dirty airplane I’ve been in, gum sticked to the chairs, drops of dry dirt everywhere, the table is dirty also something was poured on it and wasn’t cleaned."
Air Algerie,"Not Verified|  Very nice cabin, comfortable seats and good entertainment systems. The food tasted very good and there was enough food for the flight length. The flight attendants were all very friendly except 1 steward. (Plane: 7T-VJA, Date: 8 July 2019)."
Air Algerie,"Not Verified|  Paris to Oran. Very bad service for an extremely expensive price. The plane cabin was dirty, the seats uncomfortable. The cabin crew were incompetent and very haughty. Take this airline only when absolutely necessary. If you choose to spend your vacation it is a very bad choice. Unfortunately this company puts our country to shame"
Air Algerie,"✅Trip Verified|  Amman to Barcelona via Algiers. I would not recommend this airlines at all. During my trip from Amman to Barcelona through Algiers, all my checked in luggage was lost, and it has not been found since. I submitted two claims, but the airline never got back to me (not answering phone or email)."
Air Algerie,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Algiers. There was a slight delay, but the service onboard was excellent. Clean, very nice food and friendly personnel. Very pleased with the whole experience. Would fly Air Algerie again."
Air Algerie,"✅Trip Verified|  Algiers to Paris, the worst airline ever. Aircraft is old and dirty. Flight time was delayed and postponed. The check in process at counter is very slow. The only efficiency thing is their system down time. The staff is not well trained etc."
Air Algerie,"✅Verified Review|  Bamako to Algiers. A 21:15 flight was delayed around 21:30. This was the first we heard anything. At around 22:30 we were told the plane would take off the next day. We were fed by 23:00. Around 00:00 shuttles started to a hotel. I got yelled at by airline personnel while boarding a shuttle. The last of us got to the hotel around 2:30 where we were dropped off with no information. The hotel was absolutely horrid. The hotel personnel shared no flight information so around noon the next day I asked for a number for the Air Algerie personnel who'd made the reservation. He picked up after about 3 calls and told me not to call back. Around 17:00 we were told to be ready to depart at 00:00. Around 23:40 2 shuttles came. There was a mad, unorganized rush to board the shuttles because there wasn't enough space. I got pushed and shoved but left behind. One shuttle left the hotel without having its door closed. Around 00:30 another shuttle came and I managed to get on. After standing in line at the airport for an hour I got a new boarding pass. I was assured that the luggage that I had handed over the previous day would be on the plane. Service on the flight was fairly decent. Plane landed around 8:00 and took off fine. The seat was absolutely filthy, however, and the bathroom was disgusting. My luggage did not come in. I tried to report my luggage as lost but was told I could not because I had no baggage claim tickets (they'd been taken by the airline when I got my new boarding pass). I was told to come back the next morning at 3:00. I got yelled at again while reporting the luggage lost.  Another passenger said that a plane from Bamako was coming in at noon and we should wait so I did. luggage came in around 12:30."
Air Algerie,"✅Verified Review|  Excellent flight, good service with hearty meal (starter main course dessert tea and coffee) Duty service on board. A generous pitch for economy class seats. Note the delay at departure due to the closure of Orly airport and the flights diverted to Paris CDG."
Air Antilles,"Not Verified|  Atrocious customer service (the landline never answered), online complaint form never answered or vaguely answered or rarely answered. They also remove, amend, cancel what you have type on their online form (what they call e-ticket) so as to hide their suspicious activities or behaviour. You have to fight to get your money back (if you still have energy left after 3 months of constant harassment from me let alone 1 year) if it happens that you need to claim a refund. It has been a very traumatic experience for me and as far as I'm concerned this would be the last time I will be taking this airline."
Air Antilles,"✅Trip Verified|  This airline has constant maintenance issues, the plane on arrival lost one engine. The replacement plane came in late, we were told they were in touch with the connecting airline, someone would be getting us from the plane and immediately escort us to the connecting flight. They confirmed multiple times that the connecting airline would hold. When we landed, we saw the connecting flight pull away from the gate. The connection was only available once per week. They would take no responsibility, we had to buy a ticket to another airport (Fort-de-France) to catch a connection to our destination the next day. Change fees, extra ticket, hotel for the night, taxi, food, etc. cost us $500 per person. Air Antilles lied to us every step along the way and did not cover a penny of the extra expenses they were responsible for. Do not fly this airline."
Air Antilles,"✅Trip Verified|  Point-à-pitre to Saint Martin. This airline is disgusting. They have no respect for people or their time. They are the most unhelpful and rudest people we have ever encountered on an airline. They were unwilling to help us try to book an earlier flight, after discovering the plane was delayed two hours which would have made us late for an unexpected funeral we were to attend. Then, even though it was two hours late, they still made us go into the boarding zone, where there was no food and only warm bottles of water in an expensive vending machine. Once, the plane was finally nearing boarding time, they announced another hour of delay. Delays are common and sometimes unavoidable, However, the rudeness and complete lack of help is unacceptable. We not only felt like we were receiving attitude because we were white, we also just felt that they didn’t feel like dealing with us because they were too busy eating lunch. Unacceptable. Do not fly with them. We should not be giving them our hard earned money."
Air Antilles,"✅Trip Verified|  My first experience with this regional airline on a short hop from Point-a-Pietre to Melville Hall. Very pleasant and relaxed flight, nice staff and decent leg and hand luggage space. Will be happy to fly with them at any time again."
Air Arabia,"Not Verified|  I had a terrible experience with Air Arabia. My husband was recovering from surgery, and we planned a holiday, which turned into a nightmare due to their services. Before paying, everyone was polite, but after that, they left my family of 5 stranded. Despite having a hotel confirmation, we were left on the streets at midnight. When I tried to contact them, the response was shocking. They told me to wait until 9 am the next morning for a solution. We had a tough morning without finding a solution. As a result, we asked for our tickets to be changed so we could return home. Dealing with the situation was particularly difficult because my youngest daughter has autism. They agreed to change our tickets but asked us to pay for new ones. However, I have all the proof and all the records, but they just prefer to keep silent. I tried to find a suitable solution no way and the worst is when you go to their office or send an email your case will be handled by unprofessional staff who have no idea what you are talking about."
Air Arabia,"Not Verified| You can't imagine how bad their customer service is. It was about 5-6 hours delayed, and I was travelling with my 2 little daughters (3 & 6) and they refused my compensation. They even didn't even serve the food for my small daughters. I knew how difficult my day was with this long delay and with my 2 little daughters."
Air Arabia,"Not Verified| Very bad customer service at Trivandrum airport check in, distracting with laptop bag and hand bag, the workers attitude is very bad while reaching the checkin counter and making the travel hectic. Poor service."
Air Arabia,"✅Trip Verified|  I had an incredibly disappointing experience with Air Arabia, one that I would never want to endure again. The lack of sufficient information on their website regarding their cancellation policy was frustrating. Despite their claim of ""free cancellation,"" they imposed numerous hurdles when I attempted to cancel my booking two weeks prior to the flight. This lack of transparency and the subsequent difficulties they placed in my path showcased a profound lack of respect and consideration for their customers. It's deeply disappointing when an airline fails to uphold their promises and prioritize the needs of their passengers."
Air Arabia,"Not Verified|   This airline sucks.  I arrived 59 minutes before flight departure, they refuse to give me boarding pass and make me pay 40$ extra to get my boarding pass, plus I don’t have luggage. I had only a small carry on of 8lbs they charged me 70$ for it, that was my last trip with this airline."
Air Arabia,"Not Verified|   I really liked everything! The pilot's voice is very pleasant and friendly. The stewardesses Fiza and Ameni Atef are very attentive and caring. I spent a most memorable and comfortable flight, flying out of Almaty to Medina. Atef, Fiza, Ameni was most helpful and hospitable."
Air Arabia,"✅Trip Verified|  On Jan 7th 2024, I had a connecting flight through Istanbul, and upon reaching Bangalore airport, I was denied boarding for my Air Arabia flight from Bangalore to Sharjah then Sharjah to Istanbul because I did not have a transit visa to transit in Istanbul. According to the information available on the Istanbul visa website and other reliable sources, a transit visa was not required for my specific case as I told in the ticket counter that I do not have check-in luggage and I do not need to leave the airport. It was a very bad experience. Do not take this airline."
Air Arabia,✅Trip Verified| My mother is 85 years old and flies alone without problems but having some difficulty opening the water bottle she asked the stewardess for help who refused. Shame! Mia madre ha 85 anni e vola da sola senza problemi ma avendo qualche difficoltà ad aprire la bottiglia dell'acqua ha chiesto aiuto alla hostess che si è rifiutata. Vergogna!
Air Arabia,"✅Trip Verified|  I did not have problem while going from Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad. My wife got free wheel chair. While Coming from Ahmedabad, we were told that wheel chair is not free, I will have to pay for wheel chair. I thought, my wife is handicap and will get wheel chair at Abu Dhabi Airport, but there also she did not get. Our plane of Air Arabia took off 90 minutes late at Ahmedabad Airport on 19th Feb. So there was only 90 minutes left to catch Etihad plane at Abu Dhabi airport. My wife could not walk, and we had to change the terminal and walking distance was more than 1 mile. I requested Etihad employees to help for wheel chair, but they told me that I have to pay for the wheel chair. Etihad planw was waiting for us, Luckily, one manager from airport called to bring wheel chair for my wife as he might have received the same information for missing passengers. Air Arabia is the worst airline I have ever experienced in my life."
Air Arabia,"✅Trip Verified|  It was my worst experience. My first try of air Arabia and it will be my last. Bad experience not good for traveling with baby. They took our hand bags and baby travel trolley and kept telling us its company policy. I asked to show me the policy they refused. We bought a travel stroller for the baby specifically for the comfort of our baby and respecting the airline rules, still they refuse to let it in. The flight attendant the guy was like, make review like who cares. I never felt so disrespected like this time. Never recommend this airline"
Air Astana,"Not Verified|   2 days ago we already had a delay of 3 hours from Almaty to Astana where we had to offboard the plane and change planes. Now, going back to Almaty, we already got 5 mails telling us the flight will be delayed, already more than 5 hours!! I am getting the idea we will not fly today. What a bad first experience with Air Astana."
Air Astana,"Not Verified|   Excellent flight, comfort, service, politeness. The flight is around 2.5 hrs long, and we were served a decent meal, a good selection of beverages, provided good entertainment in comfortable seats. MTotally recommended!"
Air Astana,"Not Verified| I upgraded from Economy to Economy Sleeper on this 8 hour flight. This gives you a row of three standard economy seats to yourself in a separate and quieter segment of the cabin between economy and business. You also get a mattress, pillow and duvet, the idea being that you can sleep across the three seats. This does not really work because: 1. If you try to lie flat your feet stick out into the aisle 2. If you prop yourself up (sitting) with your back to the window, the inner arm rest sticks into your back. 3. The mattress which is meant to be attached via straps to the seats slides off easily when you move. 4. If there is turbulence and you have to fasten your seat belt it is not possible to do this while lying horizontally across the seats. 5. Standard economy seats lack the depth needed lie down comfortably across them. 6. You cannot watch a programme on the entertainment system in a horizontal position. I tried for a while to find a comfortable position but gave up in the end and just sat in my reclined seat. It’s a nice idea and was worth a try but it does not deliver. It was quite a costly upgrade too and the airline would be better served converting that mid-section into proper premium economy with more comfortable and spacious seats. Of the 5-6 rows on each side of the cabin, only two were occupied, which perhaps reflects the point I am making about value for money. The service throughout was excellent and my review and ratings refer specifically to the Economy Sleeper offer."
Air Astana,"Not Verified|  I'm a frequent traveller and this was our first time using Air Astana from London to Delhi. I read some great reviews nevertheless, I was quite apprehensive to say the least. Well, how wrong was I, Air Astana in my humble opinion is indeed providing amazing in flight service and great user experience. We flew Airbus 321LR that appeared to be fairly new, extremely clean and looked after. Our economy cabin was looked after well, we had nice amenity kit, the food served was nice and tasty and with proper cutlery. Equally, choice of beverages was excellent too. The crew is well trained and do their best to keep passengers happy. On the improvement side, we spent about 3+ hours in Almaty and found the airport to be quite small and quite basic which I think is a bit of let down and so I think that's the area they need to actively work on if they really want to get more customers flying with them. I certainly will fly with them again and recommend it."
Air Astana,"✅Trip Verified|  The plane was fantastic and entertainment was pretty good too. However, encountered multiple issues that ruined an otherwise fantastic trip to Almaty and an excellent flying experience. Firstly on the way from Bangkok to Almaty. I was given the option of three meals: chicken with rice, chicken with noodles and vegetarian rice. I proceeded to order the chicken with rice, which had no chicken in it, when I informed the air hostess about this, her response was initially there is no chicken with rice and when I told her that her colleague said it, she then said there's chicken in it when there obviously wasn't. When I mentioned it again, she said that she will come back to me if there's any meals remaining and never came back. I let this issue go as the overall flight experience was good. Secondly on our flight from Almaty to Delhi. The air hostess asked me whether I wanted the vegetarian or non-vegetarian option. I obviously said the non-vegetarian and she mentions it's over and the person next to me received the last one. I was okay with that but then she asks the people after me the same question and somehow they end up getting one. Finally when we got to Delhi. We purchased an additional luggage for a total of 3 from Almaty but they've recorded it as 4 which led to more than an hour of waiting till they issued our boarding pass to the corresponding flight. Overall very disappointed with the delays and meal availability which ruined an otherwise excellent flight. I would seriously reconsider flying Air Astana again."
Air Astana,"✅Trip Verified|  We had booked and paid flight from ALA to TAS and back. Since it was a vacation trip we made decision to take a train to Tashkent instead of airplane to enjoy the desert scenery. On a way back at the airport of TAS while trying to checkin the flight TAS-ALA it was said to us that we cannot fly back because we didn't use the first segment of the flight and money cannot be returned as well. Employees at Air Astana office in Tashkent were rude and kept saying that this is our problem and we should learn about airline rules before. Luckily we had enough money to stay in Tashkent for 1 more night and book a train on a next day, but what if someone has an emergency case or simply have no enough money? Btw the price for the flight we were refused to join, 2hr before departure was about $300-350 per person for 1.5hr flight, so it's pricey."
Air Astana,"✅Trip Verified|  I had have one of the best experiences with Air Astana because my April trip from Dubai to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty and Astana and back included 6 flights and all  were in time. Different types of aircrafts, such as B767 from DXB to ALA, Airbus 321 long range from ALA to NQZ Astana and Embraer E2 to UKK, all were clean and their condition was also good. Of course in this challenge A321Long range definitely wins because it was brand new. As for food everything was nice and wide choice of beverages is still available as before pandemic. And one more thing I took part in air Astana stop over holidays program for international travellers and my hosting in Almaty and Astana in hotels was very friendly. On international flights airline gives complimentary amenity kit even in economy class. I just have to mention that my screen of entertainment system on my way from Dubai to Almaty didn't work. That's why I took one point from my overall mark."
Air Astana,Not Verified| I fly this airline weekly for Almaty-Baku-Almaty and I have never ever had the flight on time. 40-60 minutes delay is routine for Air Astana. They have to reassess their attitude and schedule because those repetitive delays are not acceptable for what they call 4-star airline. The airline prices are not on level of service they provide either - Disappointing service to be honest.
Air Astana,"✅Trip Verified| This is really a different airline. The plane was impeccable, clean, looked young. Cabin staff is really amazing, taking care and checking during the hole flight. Food was exquisite. The Samsonite amenity kit was amazing, sleek and modern. A real pleasure to travel on this airline."
Air Astana,"✅Trip Verified|  I booked with Air Astana for a flight from Tashkent to Astana transiting in Almaty. Our flight was delayed for over an hour in Astana - an additional one hour later than my original booking. This meant that I now have too short a transit time and need to be re-scheduled. I received an SMS advising that I am rescheduled for a morning flight (arrival 10 a.m. the next day instead of 6 pm) I then went into frantic messages to my hotel in Astana cancelling my booking - about AUD100 extra for a few hours! On check-in I was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me. So I am unaware of this, land in Almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher. There, I am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm. So, again, frantic messages to my hotel - after over 20 minutes running around to get a Kazakh SIM card - to re-book my room. I found the place now fully booked. Called them and thankfully, they re-booked my room."
Air Austral,✅Trip Verified|   A feeder flight from Madagascar to Réunion was delayed by 1.25 hours because it was held over to pick up corresponding passengers in Mayotte and I missed by corresponding flight to Paris. The Paris flight need have only waited 15 minutes to allow our connection. I am now delayed 24 hours until the next flight. Unbelievable!
Air Austral,"Not Verified|  Air Austral is terrible. We booked a flight to the Seychelles with a layover in La Reunion. Then they changed the first flight to one day earlier and the second flight to four days later. So we were supposed to stay 5 days in La Reunion instead of a few hours. We would loose 4 days out of 7 on the Seychelles. Of course we don’t accept this proposal. Online we just could ""accept"" the change. So we went to an Air Austral office to not accept and cancel this flights, that it want be a no-show. To contact Air Austral online we need to wait 20 days for an answer. The guy in the office confirmed us, that he cancelled it and we must ask for the refund on the homepage of Air Austral, what we did. So we did everything that's possible, but the answer of Air Austral is nope. They don’t give us the refund of the flights! Of course we are very upset and will never ever again book with them. What a bad service. By the way, we are frequent flyer and never had a similar issue like this."
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified|  We reached airport with my children and they mandated to do RT PCR test to return from Mauritius to india for my children who is only 5 years old and not yet attained 6. In the website they have not mentioned that a RTPCR is required for children for age 5. When i said it is their duty to inform the passengers about the mandatory documents to carry for boarding ,they said it should be known by you. First he asked me to take RTPCR test for entire family even after i have shown him the fully vaccinated certificate. Food served in the flight from reunion to Chennai is the worst food. They changed the travel date all of a sudden. Earlier it was booked for 27 July from Chennai and then they rescheduled to 30th."
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified| We booked the return flights for two people last October via Opodo and couldn't go due to the Covid restriction. We cancelled the flights immediately and Opodo helped us proceed. However, the airline company Air Austral did not issue the refund even when they have confirmed the cancellation. And every time we asked about it, they threw the problem to Covid, which is not reasonable. It has been 5 months already that they did not proceed the refund."
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified| Mauritius to Madagascar via Reunion Island. The flight has been delayed from 4 to 7 and now 9.15 pm, no communication or support from the ground staff. They knew about the delay before the departure from Mauritius but did not inform the customers. Acces to lounge was given only after insistence from us and only to who has asked for it, not to all afected travelers, and no airline representative has spoken to us, as we should be grateful for the lounge access. No alternative connection was offered. Kids and old people were left without even water and waiting confused. Very unprofessional staff and airline!"
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified|  Johannesburg to St Denis. Service like it was 30 years ago, professional, attentive, amenity kit handed out on a 3 hour flight, and the quality and quantity of the catering I've not seen for years. Thoroughly recommended."
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified|  I have flown with the airline at least six flights in the last three years. So far, I am pleased with the airline's punctuality and the services of flight attendants on board. Unfortunately, my 2019 flight in 23 June was very unpleasant. Started from at least the 15-hour delay of the flight, and there was not at all any special offer on board. The delay caused me to pay more at the hotel. The latest flight in July was terrible. Boeing 787-8 was booked, but A330 I was in. Headache during the flight , and asked for pills from the attendant but it was ignored. Terrible."
Air Austral,✅Trip Verified|  Paris to Reunion. Air Austral is a fairly good airline. The seat layout of the Airbus A330-200 was 2x4x2. The leg room was not too bad. In-flight entertainment was good and worked well. Cabin service was average but generally fine. The flight was on time.
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified|  La Réunion to Paris. We missed our connection flight because of the delay of the the first flight with Air Austral. The worst thing about was the service of the staff at the airport at CDG. At first they denied to speak English and booked us for a flight 7 hours later, but other travelers were book on an earlier flight with the same destination. Vouchers for food or drinks were also denied although it is EU law. It was the impoliteness and ignorance of the staff that made the experience with Air Austral this bad."
Air Austral,"✅Trip Verified|  Reunion to Chennai. We were really disappointed in this Air austral. Around 13 hrs delay, they dint provide lounge, and food to still for 4 hours and then all complaint the ground staff and then they issue a burger and one drinks. All ground staff is not at all responding. It’s really bad service."
Air Bagan,RGN-SNW. Quick boarding with allocated seating for 45 minute flight in ATR72 to Ngapali Beach. Good safety briefing before time take off and light snack and drink en route. Pleasant FA's smooth flight and great landing over the surf and through the palm trees to this small exRAF WW11 strip on the Bay of Bengal. Luggage is delivered by handcart to the entrance gates-expect to pay 500kyat per piece.
Air Bagan,Flew 2 internal flights in Burma with this local airline. Surprisingly new plane pretty much on time and with very pleasant crews. Also served a good snack gave out towels although flights were only about 45 minutes. Was a bit reticent about using them but very pleasantly surprised.
Air Bagan,Flew on four separate legs within Myanmar and found them to be surprisingly good. You don't normally expect catering on flights of under an hour but there was something on all segments. Arrived in good time at Heho Airport for a flight to Yangon and they automatically put me on to an earlier departure. There is a certain amount of third world amateurism about the boarding process but it all seemed to work.
Air Bagan,Took two domestic flights on Air Bagan one from Yangon to Bagan and another Mandalay to Yangon. Both flights were with ATR-72 aircraft. The interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space. The aircraft definitely showed its old age. The flight from Mandalay to Yangon was free seated and flight was completely full. The in-flight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks. Regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky. Also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures. Yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy. For both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail. Air Bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today.
Air Bagan,Recently flew throughout Myanmar on the following routes: Yangon-Mandalay-Heho-Mandalay-Nyaung U (Bagan)-Heho-Thandwe-Yangon on their Fokker 100 and ATR72 aircraft. Check-in interesting as there are no computers and everything is weighed manually. Ground crew cordial but not overly friendly. Flight crews were friendly and always helpful. Catering is good for the short flights with croissants and drinks being offered on even the shortest of flights (unthinkable in Europe). Aircraft's were always spotless and comfortable.
Air Bagan,Ground service is terrible compared to in the air. Manual check-in process with no computers. This airline seems to be the only one to have a lounge in the domestic terminal in Yangon. Air-conditioned and friendly associates offering a cheese croissant. No bathroom inside so that was a drag. People in Lotus class got a private van to the plane which was nice compared to cramming onto a bus. Onboard the flight was pretty good. The front of the plane is much quieter compared to the back. Their inflight magazine was pretty decent and the english grammatically correct. Even on short flights they gave you food. On my YGN-MDY flight which was about 50 minutes they served a full breakfast. Seats were pretty comfortable on par with United A320 first class seats. I don't really see the need for inflight entertainment on such short flights.
Air Bagan,Yangon-Bagan. ATR-72. Decent plane old and tired but as you'd expect from an airline in Burma. There was 1 cabin crew member and the co-pilot. Very pleasant service and a nice cheese croissant for the flight. Completely empty so you could stretch out over two seats which is important for me being 6ft 3.
Air Bagan,Chiang Mai to Yangon return and pleasantly surprised by the standard - fairly new aircraft and meal service for 50 minute flight. Flight attendants were somewhat offhand. Reasonable leg room in economy.
Air Bagan,Four internal flights in the last three weeks. Three on time one an hour late and this because a party of VIPs decided to turn up an hour after the scheduled take-off time. All flights satisfactory. Planes in OK condition. Even on short flights we were served refreshments. Nothing computerised and the whole process completed manually. When joining flights outside Yangon (the starting point for most flights) there is 'free' seating. This is because the systems are unable to work out which seats are vacated at each stop.
Air Bagan,Yangon to Lashio in November 2009 ATR 42 plane. Allocated seating and good snack served with excellent customer service. Would fly with them again any time!
Air Belgium,✅Trip Verified|  Air Belgium for Srilankan Airlines. Uncomfortable business class seat looks well used only good thing was the massage function. Mix of crew from Air Belgium and Srilankan mostly friendly. Food was tasty and filling a good variety to chooses from. Toilet wasn't overly clean.
Air Berlin,"✅Trip Verified|  Florence to London via Dusseldorf in September 2017. First flight from Florence delayed by 3 hours, resulting in missed connection. This wouldn't have been an issue, especially considering the airline was meant to reimburse all customers for costs of the delay. However, my checked baggage was misplaced. Again, this wouldn't have been an issue under normal circumstances. I spoke to the baggage handler who told me to come talk to him prior to the next mornings flight, which was due to leave at 6am. I was forced to pay for a taxi which totalled 100 Euro each way (with promises of reimbursement) to the hotel which the company had placed passengers in only to stay there for 4 hours before having to leave again to catch the rescheduled flight. When I went to see the baggage handler I wasn't able to find anyone in the department. I went to the Air Berlin help desk and after explaining the situation to the woman at the desk she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if she was able to call the person who handled baggage as I needed to put my checked luggage on the new flight and she said she could but wasn't going to. When I asked again, saying ""Please, I need to catch my flight on time. I can't wait for someone to answer me knocking at the door, my flight leaves in less than an hour and I have to go through security"" She promptly said to me (in these exact words) ""Why don't you just do everyone a favour and go away."" I flew to my destination sans baggage and deeply offended. Being under 19 years old at the time and a solo flyer I am to this day outraged by the lack of sympathy and understanding of the customer support team. I had to wait 4 whole weeks for my luggage to arrive at my final destination. The airline owes me over 500 Euros in reimbursement, which it has managed to avoid paying due to their own fiscal troubles. I hope this airline is never resurrected and that no one is treated like that in there travels."
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Düsseldorf to Catania via Rome. Booked Alitalia, got Air Berlin. I was prepared for delays and even cancellations, because of the insolvency of Air Berlin. And indeed: our original inbound flight from Catania tot Düsseldorf with a change in Milan was cancelled, but within 10 minutes we were moved to the direct AB-flight CTA-DUS. Even better. So we had two punctual flights, with a friendly crew and reasonably priced drinks. Leg room was awful however. I like the small route screens on Air Berlin aircraft. But it's all over since Air Berlin stops flying in a few days, so no recommendation. Pity, because Air Berlin was one of my favourite airlines. Never had any problems."
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Milan to New York return via Dusseldorf. I had a very positive experience with AirBerlin - on all four of our flights. The prices were phenomenal - all four of us flew economy roundtrip for less $2,200 - although they did charge me quite a bit for seat reservations - with 2 small kids, you can't really make a good case for 'oh honey sorry you get to sit to that stranger."" Everything ran on time. The seats are as about tight as most US airlines - though not as bad as United's back rows. But we fit fine, video was working (with lots of options for watching), food was ok-ishand the attendants were quite helpful and very nice. Really, I have no complaints. And yes, I did check in luggage on the way back - because who doesn't overshop in Italy? - and I got them back in NYC. We were all nervous about this due to all the bad review of lost luggage. In fact it is why I am writing the review - as I promised myself I would write a good review if we arrived home intact with a good experience. I fly Business for work - I was expecting worse but was very pleased as were my husband two kids (8, 10)"
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Berlin to Prague. Worst experience I’ve had for a while! They announce 2 hour delay, then no info until we understand that once they have a plane they must wait for a new crew. Very bad organisation and communication. Definitely avoid if you can, lost my time and couldn’t make my meetings."
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Frankfurt to Berlin, our first flight was cancelled but they arranged me other flight. Next day I use Air Berlin also this time their service was on time and good service and cabin crew - they are very friendly and helpful. I was very happy their service."
Air Berlin,✅Verified Review|  Berlin to Warsaw. This is worst experience I had. Staff are really rude. They don't have enough information about flight. I had three different information last 10 minutes. I have been waiting for my flight over 2 hours and flight is delayed. And Airberlin's staff still can't give any information about flight.  I don't recommend it at all.
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Worst airline ever, poor customer care. Representatives are rude and not helpful. My flight from San Francisco to Prague (with only one connection stop) was cancelled without any notification and explanation as to why. Air Berlin representative was not helpful at all. We were told that we would be flying via a different airline, however, didn't give any information regarding flight number, refused to print any documents proving that we had the new flight with a different airline. In addition, they gave us a flight with two stops (we could have find tickets much cheaper with two stops). Do not recommend this airline, they just lost two customers. On my way back another Air Berlin representative was extremely rude, plus she overcharged us for overweight luggage (we had to pay 100 euros for 27 kg luggage). On the board they didn't offer any drinks (water or coffee) from Prague to Berlin."
Air Berlin,✅Verified Review|  Bonn to Prague via Berlin. Absolutely bad experience. I bought flight at 5pm from Berlin and instead they put me on flight at 9pm. Nobody was able to explain me why. After staying in line for almost an hour to actually talk with someone they tell me that I have flight for today so they don't understand why is my problem - if they would tell me up front that the flight at 5pm will not happen I would fly directly from Bonn to Prague at 7 pm. These people are cheating their customers.
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Helsinki to Berlin return.  the terminal in Berlin looks like an abandoned warehouse. The Boeing 737 had the A320 safety sheet. The seats were leather, and quite worn out. The flight left TXL on time. I am an Emerald member on one world however they did not recognise me on this flight nor the departing flight (no greeting, benefit, drinks, nothing). They charge 2.5 Euros for a cup of tea and the inflight entertainment via wifi must be purchased. Not recommended as they are pricier than budget airlines."
Air Berlin,"✅Verified Review|  Berlin to Geneva via Dusseldorf. Not a good first impression. First segment no order to boarding process just one long line regardless if your seat assignment. Delayed 30 minutes announced 10 minutes before scheduled boarding time. No explanation why. Onboard, the least amount of legroom I have ever experienced. Take off was finally one hour later. Second flight delayed 35 minutes to late arrival of the aircraft."
Air Botswana,Not Verified|   The Flight Attendants were polite. My major issue was that they airline broke my luggage and when I confronted them about it in Botswana they did not care. I have flown all around the world and never seen an airline clearly not take responsibility for their mistakes. I would advise avoiding this airline at all cost.
Air Botswana,"✅Trip Verified|  Air Botswana is consistent in letting down their passengers. My family and I have had 4 encounters with Air Botswana and we were let down 4 times. First my mother received an itinerary and a payment confirmation only to arrive at the airport to be told that her ticket was not issued and that she would have to purchase another. She complained about this and Air Botswana tried to calm the situation down stating that she will be reimbursed for the purchase. The second issue was that i had a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Gaborone with air Botswana. My initial flight was from Cape Town. 2hrs before my departure from Cape Town i get informed that the flight from Johannesburg to gabs was cancelled. I was forced to take the flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg but to purchase accommodation for the next day for when air Botswana could give me another flight. I was not reimbursed for the expenses incurred. The third issue is the same as the first which happened to my brother who experienced the same issue as my mother. The fourth issue occurred this morning when I arrived at the check im desk after having travelled 300km on road to get to Gaborone Airport I was inform that although I have a payment confirmation from DPO Pay, Air Botswana had still not received any reflected money in their account and thus would have to purchase another ticket from the ticket sales. This resulted in me having to pay all my travel money and borrowing some to purchase this ticket. I am a student and one can only imagine the difficulty this caused. Air Botswana is consistent in giving trouble and all 4 times my family and I have travelled with them we had problems. When you see this many negative reviews take heed."
Air Botswana,"✅Trip Verified|  We bought our Maun to Johannesburg in october. At this time the flight departure were at 1:50pm landing in Joburg at 4pm giving us 3h35 to catch our flight for Europe. 3 weeks before our departure I received a notification about this flight. It has been delayed to 3pm and will land in Joburg at 6pm. Leaving us with 1h35 to catch our flight in Joburg. Quite difficult to do but doable. I wrote to customer service to ask them if it will be ok to have such a short transit time in Joburg, but they never answered me. When we arrived in Maun, we told the Air Botswana representative that we had to register on our flight to Europe because we will not have time to do it. They told us that they will try to. 30 min before departure, we learned by Canadian tourists that the flight had been delayed to 5pm. We ask Air Botswana to book us on another flight for Europe. After long minutes on their back they told us that we were booked on Virgin Atlantic instead of Swiss. It was ok for us even if the transit time would be short (1h20). We only wanted to be in Paris the next morning, so making a stop in Zurich or London wasn't an issue for us. During the flight we asked flight attendants that we will have a short transit time in Joburg and to organize something to make sure we catch our virgin Atlantic flight. We had to ask twice because we made a stop in Gaborone and flight attendants changed. When we arrived a van was there to drive us to the virgin atlantic terminal. Everything seems fine right? Well when we wanted to check in on Virgin Atlantic, the attendants told us that my ticket could not be emitted, leaving my wife alone. No one at Air Botswana told us that there was a problem with the ticket. Due to their incompetence, we had to sleep at the airport hotel. No one form air Botswana helped us for the room booking, Bid airservices employees were the best, they did the hotel room booking for us on behalf of Air Botswana. The next day, we had to stand in front of Air Botswana counter from 10am to 3pm in order to have our ticket to Paris. The manager were unbearable and supercilious. They lied to us numerous time, we had to put pressure on them to have some information about the situation. Note that we booked the whole trip (Maun to Paris) they had to pay for the rest of our journey (air france ticket were 2500 $ per person in premium economy, economy was fully booked). We were with Canadian tourists who didn't book the whole trip and they had to buy again Johannesburg - Montreal ticket something like 3000 $. This was the worst travel experience of my life. And during Air Botswana flight you can't use your smartphone even if it's in airplane mode, and there is no entertainment proposed."
Air Botswana,"✅Verified Review|  I was booked on flight BP211 from Maun to Johannesburg, scheduled to depart at 13:50 and arriving at 15:50 on 23 April. At about 13:00 we got a notice that the flight had been delayed to 15:20. No reason was given for the delay. The ground staff assured us that we will be arriving in Johannesburg at about 16:50. Some passengers had connecting flights and were assisted by the ground staff. We were also assured that the plane is on its way and that we will depart for Johannesburg at 15:20. At 15:15 the noticeboard started flashing indicating that we can board, but there was still no plane in sight. Later the flight details disappeared from the noticeboard, but still no plane. Eventually the plane arrived and we started boarding proceedings. We exited the building and upon reaching the plane the cabin crew told us that their plane is going to Gaborone and not Johannesburg. We had to stand around on the tarmac while the crew were running around trying to sort out the mess and calm some very upset passengers down. Eventually we were allowed to get aboard - we were going to be flown to Gaborone and there board another plane to go to Johannesburg. During the flight the captain apologized and told us that the change was because of some technical problems with the other plane. The transition in Gaborone was smooth. We eventually arrived in Johannesburg at 18:36 and I am sure some passengers missed their connecting flights. They were assured that there would be ground staff in Johannesburg to assist them with the transitions. We were all put in the same bus to the terminals and I did not see any assistants when we arrived at the terminals. My biggest issue with Air Botswana is not being truthful with us, their paying customers, in some instances flat-out lying and then dumping us on an unaware operator flight crew, leaving them to attend to upset and frustrated passengers. Very unprofessional."
Air Botswana,✅Verified Review| Johannesburg to Gaborone with Air Botswana. Fast check in at airport. On time boarding and departure. Full flight operated by an ATR 42. Good Crew. A good snack of crackers and local beef jerky served. Landed on time. Fast immigration and was out of airport in minutes. Return flight on same day. Again fast check in. Fast Security control and immigration. On time departure on a newer ATR 72. Rather empty flight with everyone having an empty seat next to them. Good snack and wide array of drinks served by a crew happy to do more than their best. On time arrival in JNB. Small airline but they know what they are doing. Recommended on visits to Botswana.
Air Botswana,CPT-GBE GBE-JNB. First flight a clean Bae146 in very good condition half empty with loads of leg room. Food excellent for an airline and service find. Second flight on an equally clean ATR72 with equally good snacks. All flights on time. Much prefer them to SAX or Airlink!
Air Botswana,I will never fly Air Botswana again. Warning to anyone who is considering flying with them: if you expect even mediocre customer service do yourself a favor and stay away. We were supposed to fly from Maun with Air Botswana to land in Johannesburg landing at 4 pm with a full four hours to spare before our long haul flight back to the US via Delta. When we arrived at the Maun airport chaos had ensued. What appeared to be a huge tour group had the spotlight and despite reaching the front of the line to check in we were completely ignored as the attendants told us they needed to tend to others first. Service was exorbitantly slow as there were only 2 attendants who were hand writing boarding passes. After an hour of waiting we were told the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on. We’re convinced that although we had booked our flights 6 months earlier we were bumped along with about 20 others from the flight in favor of the tour group. You can imagine the hysteria as the majority of the 20 had connecting flights in Johannesburg. The attendants assured us that we would get on another plane that was routed to Cape Town but would first stop in Johannesburg to drop us off by 6 pm. We found this odd but at that point had no other choice. It was only after we boarded the plane that we discovered we were instead going to Gaborone and from there another plane would take us to Johannesburg immediately. When we reached Gaborone the Air Botswana rep was extremely confused why we had arrived and told us we had been lied to and would have to wait another 1.5 hours to take off. Not surprisingly the flight was further delayed so we finally arrived in Jo'burg at 8.30 minutes after our second leg to Atlanta took off. We were extremely upset but told we’d be waitlisted for the next Delta flight out - which unfortunately was not for a full 24 hours. The real kicker? We were told you owe us $650 USD. Still can’t quite comprehend how they had the gall to say this to our faces but at this point nothing surprised us. No reps from either Air Botswana or Delta were available to give us a definitive answer on whether we’d be guaranteed to be on the flight so off we went to a local hotel in hopes of returning the next day to get everything straightened out. The people who work for this airline not only have the poorest customer service skills I have ever witnessed. When we arrived on day 2 to try to check in to Delta we were told we only had a 50/50 shot of getting on the plane. There is one flight per day and subsequent flights were all booked solid. We were beginning to think this nightmare might continue on for days and days. Surely there had to be a carrier going to any city in the US that could accommodate us. There was. Two in fact. However Air Botswana would need to book it for us – and they flat out refused. We were only able to get on the Delta flight thanks to their management; the Air Botswana rep was never to be heard from again. I could not be more appalled at the way Air Botswana operates.
Air Botswana,Fantastic Service. Booked from Australia for Jo'burg to Maun flight. Kept great communications for any changes and even transferred me on a SA flight no extra charge for my Kasane-Jo'burg leg when I explained about connection time with my Qantas flight due to schedule changes without having to be asked and emailed me back a new booking. Great service nice snack on a short leg clean modern plane on time friendly ground staff. I hear things might have been different a few years back but certainly my experience was very good and would fly with them again.
Air Botswana,Francistown - Johannesburg 16 September. Good short flight efficiently run with good crew. On time and no problems.
Air Botswana,In August Johannesburg to Maun and Kisane to Johannesburg. Both flights were spot on time. Service on board was fine with drinks and light snacks served for the roughly 2 hour flight in each direction. Aircraft's were in good shape and the seats comfortable for this type of trip. Check-in in Jo'burg was easy and very quick. Check- in in Kisane was a breeze as the airport is tiny. All in a good experience and a great way to enhance your Botswana experience.
Air Burkina,"✅Trip Verified| Overall a positive experience with Air Burkina. This route is a triangle from Ouagadougou to Accra to Abidjan and back. Check-in wasn't fast but was well managed. 10-minute boarding delay was communicated individually by staff but the plane was ultimately on time. Free seating - not an issue as it wasn't fully booked. Clean and fairly well-maintained albeit slightly worn ex-Royal Jordanian plane, good leg room, 12 years old. (There was some tape on both emergency exit handle covers.) Courteous English/French speaking cabin crew and good cockpit communications. 50 minute flight had a good selection of cold drinks including French wine. Luggage arrived without incident."
Air Burkina,"✅Trip Verified|  I was booked to fly non stop from Abidjan to Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) with Air Burkina. Their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver ,and in a few minutes my ETKT was issued. I guess i was smart to ask the Concierge at my hotel in Abidjan to confirm my flight the day before.Air Burkina had my email,but no notices whatsoever re the dramatic change.To my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled, and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115. I was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in Abidjan. Im sure the Concierge understood well the new information he received from Air Burkina's office. To my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait, as 'there is a problem with my ticket'. I waited patiently till ALL passengers were checked in, and then i was told by hand signs (No English spoken by the check in supervisor) that the flight is full, and to go and see the agents at Air Burkina's office in the terminal. There i was told by an agent that I'm booked on a different flight at 3pm. I insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight, as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city. I was promised i had a seat at 3pm,but already i had my doubts at that point. I asked why they didn't accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight, and even if i had no reservation per their version, i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight. ""No"" was the answer. Reason: the flight was stopping in Accra where it was going to be filled up 100%. I told the agents that i thank them for their efforts, and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for 'maybe' flying at 3pm. I left their office trying to figure out a way out of Ivory Coast as i had a Business class ticket on Ethiopian from Ouagadougou to Addis Ababa, and hoped Ethiopian Airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from Abidjan to Addis. Suddenly i was approached by the Air Burkina agent, who offered me to pay 'penalty' for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50Euro - I had to pay Air Burkina 50 EURO because THEY cancelled my flight. Amazing! The 100% full flight from Accra excuse was no longer an issue. I decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of Air Burkina, so i don't miss my visit to Burkina Faso for 50 Euro. I paid, and quickly was rushed to the aircraft. Out of Accra there were at least 20 empty seats and Business class was 100% empty. So much for correct information. The aircraft was an ex LOT airliner in terrible shape, torn seats, dirty cabin, toilets without toilet paper. Drinks were served from Abidjan to Accra's 30 minute flight,and a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from Accra to Ouagadougou. Quite impressive service. What a poor show of caring for customers at Abidjan airport. And their website says that ""the customer is at the center of all they do"" - really?"
Air Busan,"Not Verified|   Apart from the fact that the crew at Incheon were a little rude, everything was perfect. For a low cost airline, the seats were very comfy and the legroom was amazing. I would definitely recommend this airline."
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified| They took us in to the plane at 12.30 pm. After closing the doors they announced that there is problem we have to wait 1 hour. After 1 hour they said there will be additional 1.40 hours. There is no food in the plane, they expect us to sit here for long times and starve? We came here for travel, I understand that it is not the airplanes fault but we lost our whole day and now starving in the plane. I had never have such bad experience with plane! How hard to get some snacks from the head office or somewhere else?"
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified|  Clean plane, but no water served for a 6 hour flight. No meals, no inflight entertainment. Seats have USB charging which is good, but even for a budget airline, i would  expect a bottle of water and maybe a snack. I won't be in a rush to fly with Air Busan any time soon. Check in staff seemed to be unsure about visa requirements and kept me waiting for a long time (longest check in I have experienced)."
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified|  Clean plane, totally indifferent crew, but what is absolutely amazing is that, on such a long flight, the flight attendants did not distribute a single drop of water to passengers, except to those will to pay for overpriced items; not even the cheapest low cost airline(and this was not a low cost) would do better."
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified|  Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. When we arrived at the airport 90 min before departure time, the  counter was empty. Nobody up there and the automatic check-in was disabled. After walking all over to find their offices, we were greeted by an employee who told us they closed the counter 90 min prior to flight as a company policy. There was no effort on her part to open the door or offering any alternatives. I dislike that attitude in any kind of service."
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified|  Seoul to Busan. First time with Air Busan and it was great. Price, App, check in, employees, service,luggage and on time. At the check in I was offered an earlier flight, no fee. There were no problems with this airline and trip. Recommend."
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified|  Osaka to Busan. Great value budget airline. Web site and on-board magazine promise free water but none was offered. Check-in at KIX was about 20 minutes, check-in at PUS was zero with no other customers in sight. Offered decent seats even though we hadn't pre-booked them. Outward flight was delayed due to 'air traffic control restrictions' at KIX but landed on time due to timetable padding. Return flight left early but landed slightly late after circling around western Japan for ages. Boarding on both flights smooth. Bus to terminal at PUS, but sky bridge on return flight. Perfectly adequate and reasonably efficient for a budget airline and a one-hour flight. Would use again."
Air Busan,"✅Trip Verified|  My family flew to Daegu from Gimpo. From check-in to boarding, service rendered by all staff were efficient and excellent. Cabin was clean and seats were usual economy class comfy. On our return flight from Daegu to Gimpo, we were late due to traffic and could not check-in thru self serve kiosk. We had barely 15 mins prior to flight departure. Approached counter staff for assistance. First thing the staff did was radioed the Captain while processing the checking in and printing of boarding passes. An agent came over to escort and assisted us throughout the procedure to ensure we boarded the plane without further delay. All these were completed within 15 mins and flight departed on time. Our biggest compliment is towards the Captain for both flights. Journey was smooth and landing was perfect which you dont even feel the plane has landed. Flew with many major top 10 airlines in the world but never had this landing experience ever before. Cabin Crew rating, great and comparable to top airlines! Keep it up and will definitely choose and fly Air Busan on all my destinations where served by Air Busan."
Air Busan,"✅Verified Review|  Today in morning when we were coming Jeju to Busan, it was 10 minutes late, which is acceptable. But after this when all the passengers were in plane and it start to run, they stopped. We were informed that there is an issue and pilot will take plane back. We were kept waiting another few minutes and cabin manager announce that they are looking into it and will give further notice. Crew members were serving water and juice. Further notice kept happening for next two hours and plane finally moved at 12:35 pm, instead of 10:30 am. It was my first time to fly with Air Busan to Jeju, which was a disaster."
Air Busan,"Flew Air Busan from Jeju to Busan. No delays - my experience of taking budget airlines gives me an impression that they will surely delay. They served orange juice that was quite nice onboard. Smooth landing at Busan. I slept on board.  But they don't have aerobridge like Korean Air, Asiana Airlines or Jeju air."
Air Cairo,"✅Trip Verified|   Horrible experience, kept delaying with late notifications, checked in before 5 pm supposed to fly 6 pm only to finally fly after 8.30 pm with multiple delays. This was my 4th delay was this airline in 4 times i bought seat with them, basically always on delay. They did offer a snack though. Save your snack & fly on time, they are growing exponentially even intl , probably its too big for them!"
Air Cairo,"Not Verified| Horrible, they change the departure time without any notification, at commercial desk were rude and useless to find a solution. Don't give them any money they are not worth it, better pay more with another company at least you'll be sure to arrive at your destination. Flight cancelled, 1 day of vacation waiting at the airport and they just give us an orange juice, what a company!"
Air Cairo,"✅Trip Verified|  They changed the flight departure time during the Eid holiday and claim they informed the tourist agency with the change but they didn’t make sure the agency knew of this change given that we’re on Eid vacation. Bottom line is, I’m at the airport and have seen my flight take off after having the captain refused to take me on board. Just careless and don’t take matters or people seriously."
Air Cairo,✅Trip Verified|  The seat pitch and width were a bit tight. The on-board service consists of water. Other drinks and food must be purchased. Departure and arrival were on time. The cleaning condition of the toilet seats in ​​this relatively new aircraft is more than unclean.
Air Cairo,"✅Trip Verified|  We had a flight from Hurghada to Munich with Egypt Air. In turned out, that the service was executed by Air Cairo. Already before the boarding the communication with Air Cairo was bad. In contrast to the advertised online checkin the corresponding website did not work. Arriving at the airport we have been blocked from entering the building, because a speaker of the airline told that all flights of Air Cairo to Munich were cancelled. So we bought a ticket to Stuttgart with a different airline. 2 hours later the new information is, that Air Cairo flies now today to Munich. What a mess! In the aircraft it was a horrible seating, much to narrow for normal Europeans. It was a mayhem to fly with this airline. In addition very bad air quality in the air craft. I left it with head ache and serious muscle strains. Finally a meal was not included, but had to be paid in contrast to what was advertised by Air Egypt during the booking. A 150ml cup of water for a 6hours stay in the air craft."
Air Cairo,"✅Trip Verified|  I flew with my husband from Sharm El Sheikh to Cairo to see the pyramids and Egyptian Museum, with a return flight to Sharm three days later. The flight took off on time, the cabin crew were friendly and the seats were comfortable. Unfortunately my husband was taken ill in Cairo and I decided we needed to return to the UK. I cancelled our return flight on the morning we were due to fly back to Sharm. The money was in my bank two days later. I would fly Air Cairo again."
Air Cairo,✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline experience I've ever had. Ruined my last day in Egypt. Spent a total of 10 hours in airport due to delays then when arrived in Cairo baggage was also delayed.  Aircraft dirty seats uncomfortable. I booked a tour and this was the flight they sent me on. Never book with this airline. It will ruin your holiday.
Air Cairo,Not Verified|  Nice flights all on time with friendly staff for a good price. Non of the services offered could be purchased in advance (seats and meals) as all credit cards were rejected. Also shocked to see use of a kettle (!) On the floor behind row 1 in the galley!
Air Cairo,"✅Trip Verified|  Flight from Cairo to Hurghada was cancelled and they sent me an email at 10:00 pm,  8 hours before the flight time and what I didn’t realize that they also changed the airline to Egyptair. So it’s not the same terminal in Cairo, Terminal 3 instead of terminal which is 18 minutes by car. So I didn’t catch the flight and had to buy a new one way ticket for a flight after 3.5 hour! So after checking in to Hurghada airport for the return flight & everything was fine until the flight is delayed for 19:00 instead of 17:30 and my original booking was for 14:00 but they sent me an email 4 days ago that this flight is cancelled &amp. They chose to give me the sm 63 flight at 17:30. Conclusion: If you have any work on the day of the flight with this airline company be sure that you will not reach on time. Or maybe you will not reach the same day."
Air Cairo,"✅Trip Verified|  I will forever regret not treating the bad reviews seriously before traveling with Air Cairo. Their flight from Hurghada to Prague turned out to be by far the worst traveling experience of my life. First problems arose when we were notified in Hurghada that our flight was delayed by five hours. I discovered on flightradar24.com that the reason for the delay was the plane having been diverted to Skopje on a flight from Hurghada to Belgrade earlier that day. This was our first warning sign, foreshadowing what was to come next. When we finally took off and headed to Prague, the captain announced that our flight was diverted to Leipzig, Germany due to ""bad weather"" in Prague. The crew also told us that no planes were allowed to land in Prague for this reason whatsoever. When we confronted them with the fact that we were the only plane being diverted, they suddenly changed their story and claimed that our aircraft was not suitable for landing in low visibility. When we proved this to be a lie as well, they changed their story once more and told us that the pilots were inexperienced and therefore not trained for landing in foggy weather. What the real reason for the diversion was and how their side of the story would have developed had we pushed on them further, I have no idea. When we were finally allowed to leave the aircraft in Leipzig, we received no information about future plans whatsoever and the crew simply went to bed. The staff at Leipzig Airport were unable to help us either since the only people who knew at least something about our situation were asleep. At least that is what they said. Furthermore, they denied us access to our check-in luggage in spite of some passengers being in urgent need of their medication. On the plus side, Leipzig Airport provided us with beds and blankets to survive the night, for which we were thankful. Air Cairo, on the other hand, did nothing. The following morning was a disaster as well. A substitute flight from Leipzig to Prague was scheduled first for 5:30am, then for 11:00am. However, we still had no specific information as the airport staff was unable to reach the crew and the management of Air Cairo refused to communicate with us. The airport staff claimed that the only thing for which we were waiting was the crew, who were asleep at the hotel. Yet when the management of Air Cairo finally started answering our questions, they told us that the crew were already waiting at the hotel in their uniforms, not knowing themselves why they were not able to fly. What was the reason for the waiting, then? Were we waiting for the fog in Prague to disappear? We had no idea because no one bothered to tell us. After many hours of stressful waiting, during which we were again given misinformation multiple times and several passengers burst into tears, the crew finally arrived with no further explanation at 12:45pm and we took off at 1:30pm. To sum up, our landing in Prague was delayed by 20 hours. There are, however, two aspects of our situation that are most annoying. Firstly, it was argued that our issues were caused by fog. Yet we were the only plane on that day which had this problem and dozens of other aircraft were perfectly capable of taking off and landing in Prague. The problem was therefore clearly on the side of the airline and their pilots. And secondly, what I consider even more disgraceful was the arrogance with which the airline treated us and all their deception, lies and lack of communication."
Air Canada,"Not Verified| This was a crammed flight with every one of the 450 seats filled. Staff was pleasant at the outset but clearly tired and were unable to provide adequate service as the flight went on. The seats were a little wider than  economy and reclined a little more. This made the expensive upgrade worthwhile. Persons in economy were squeezed in very tight, especially the larger ones. The entertainment system was sub standard, likely a very old system. It froze at one point and it took about an hour to have it restarted after pressing the call button. Our amenity package with earphones was not at our seat. It also took a prolonged time to get staff attention to this issue."
Air Canada,"Not Verified| Air Canada, our signiture CHEAPO airline, representing the stoic cheapo best we offer. The flight from Lisbon was not unlike the three other flights that we took with AC. Un-courteous service. Spoke in French first only yet most of people were english. On both international flghts to and from Europe only offered cheap wine to drink, once with meal. Would not give full can of pop only glass and no ice. Female attendant at the gate and on the plane was totally rude, and snarky. It was as if they were doing us a favor by serving us. Worst feeling of being on a plane ever. Couple of the male attendants seems semi friendly but the women were not at all cordial to many people."
Air Canada,"✅Trip Verified| Cabins were in good condition. A330 even though an old plane was in good condition and Premium Economy is in old business class seats. Crew was nice, the crew to/from Colombia was indifferent but the crew from/to Athens was great and attending the passengers. From/to ATH to Canada food in economy was great with midflight snacks. Inflight service was tasty and nice. From YYZ-BOG I had a paid upgrade to Premium Economy and the service was great, food was delicious, there was an amenities kit, welcome drink. IFE was good but need a little upgrade with newer films."
Air Canada,"✅Trip Verified|   I am deeply disappointed with Air Canada’s handling of wheelchair assistance for my 77-year-old mother's recent travel experience. She has significant mobility issues, is a cardiac patient with back surgery. I purchased her ticket trusting Air Canada would provide the pre-arranged assistance (wheelchair) she needed. During a 1 hour and 45-minute connection in Toronto, the staff member assisting my mother told her to walk to the gate on her own, saying it ""should be a short walk."" She was left alone in the elevator without a gate number on her boarding pass. What was supposed to be a short walk turned into a long distance, causing her significant physical and emotional distress.  What makes the situation worse is that Air Canada offered a $200 travel credit as compensation, which I find inadequate. This was not just a minor service lapse—it was a failure to provide essential, pre-arranged assistance to an elderly woman with health challenges."
Air Canada,"✅Trip Verified| I paid for business class and was informed as I checked in that I was being ""downgraded."" No apologies and when I spoke to a supervisor I received a wrote series of Air Canada platitudes. The ticket was booked almost a year ago and the high handed tone of the staff was akin to, ""Not my problem."" They did tell me with great pride that I could use the lounge but I was unable to do so because I had to wait so long to speak to a supervisor that I had enough time to go through security and get to my gate. To add insult to injury, the flight staff said there would be no IFE or wifi then promptly went around trying to sell earphones for the non-existent IFE. I received a voucher for 150 CAD which of course doesn't even come close to closing the gap between economy and business class. This airline never fails to disappoint."
Air Canada,"Not Verified| Flight delayed, missed connection, lost baggage, then sent to another airport, no one wanted to know, rude staff - not just one person but the majority. Was Told to book an Uber to the airport we should have landed at and they would refund - no they would not! Can’t speak to another on phone. Don’t book a flight with this airline, the level of incompetence, I would walk rather than book a flight with this airline again."
Air Canada,"✅Trip Verified|   I planned a trip to Iran to visit my mother, and to make the journey easier, I booked a flight from Chicago to Toronto with Air Canada so I could fly with my sister from Toronto.  However, due to the rising tensions in the Middle East, all flights to Tehran were canceled. I contacted Air Canada to ask for assistance in modifying my itinerary. Unfortunately, I was met with no effort to find a solution. The only option they offered was a partial refund of around $60, even though I had paid approximately $450 for the flight. I then asked if I could retain my return flight from Toronto to Chicago but change my departure to Toronto to a week earlier, planning to book a new ticket to get to Toronto. However, I was told that if I didn’t use my outbound flight to Toronto, my return flight to Chicago (which was operated by United Airlines) would be automatically canceled.  I am extremely disappointed in Air Canada's lack of support and unwillingness to accommodate a simple request."
Air Canada,"Not Verified| Quick hop, ahead of schedule, got us to Montreal with loads of time to make the connection. Left on time, arrived LHR early. Totally uneventful flight. Late dinner pretty average, breakfast better. Crew robotically effective. Pre-booked Emergency Exit row seats quite comfortable, would not have wanted six hours in a standard economy seat. This trip the first time we have used Air Canada. On this evidence would use them again."
Air Canada,"✅Trip Verified|   My itinerary included a smooth outbound flight from Miami to Montreal and then onto Tokyo. However, the return journey from Narita to Montreal was marred by a series of unpleasant incidents. Upon landing in Montreal, the airport's disorganization and chaos became apparent. It took us an hour just to leave the airport. Given our extended 13-hour layover in Montreal, we decided to book a hotel near the airport to prepare for our final flight AC1650, scheduled to depart from gate C77 on September 15th at 8:35 AM. As we arrived at the gate, announcements were made informing passengers that the Airbus 319 was fully booked and requesting volunteers to check their carry-ons. My wife, parents, and I had two essential carry-ons, so we did not volunteer. When it was our turn to board (Group 4), an inexperienced Air Canada employee, a young woman no older than 25, approached me and asked me to place my bag in the size checker. I complied, and to my surprise, the bag, which I had used on numerous trips without issue, fit perfectly. However, the employee insisted that my bag was oversized and demanded that we must check both luggages or face being denied boarding. She even claimed that this was federal law and that we were in violation. Her unfounded claims and unprofessional demeanor left us standing there while everyone else boarded the aircraft. After a considerable wait, she finally returned and asked, ""Are you going to check your bags or do you want to speak to my manager?"" Confident that I was within my rights, I requested to see her manager. Shortly after, a more senior employee, a woman in her forties, arrived and asked, ""What's going on? Why aren't you boarding?"" I explained the situation, and she immediately asked me to place my bag in the size checker again. Upon seeing that it fit perfectly, she acknowledged, ""Yes, you can board."" However, the younger employee, clearly unwilling to admit her mistake, insisted, ""No, I've already called my manager."" After enduring unnecessary stress and waiting, my wife and I were finally allowed to board. Unsurprisingly, our bags fit perfectly in the overhead compartments, further highlighting the absurdity of the situation. This incident added to the exhaustion of a 26-hour journey and marred what should have been a routine boarding process. This experience exposed serious gaps in Air Canada's staff training and professionalism. I urge the airline to address these issues promptly and thoroughly to prevent future passengers from enduring similar frustrations. It is essential that Air Canada invests in comprehensive training programs that emphasize customer service, empathy, and adherence to company policies to ensure a seamless and positive travel experience for all passengers."
Air Canada,Not Verified| Amateur hour at AC. They knew they had a fully booked plane where every passenger has a roller bag and instead waited until half way through the boarding process to turn around passengers to gate check. They also had 45 minute delay to gate check bags before the boarding process started but elected not to. Not the conduct of a professionally run ground staff.
Air Canada rouge,"✅Trip Verified|   If it wasn’t for the convenience of the timings, we would never fly air Canada Rouge again, based on our last experience. To start, the aircraft was 26 years old (Airbus 319, reg C-GARJ) and it showed. The “business class” seats were beyond worn and uncomfortable and there was no inflight entertainment or wifi. The purser/inflight director/in charge was what really made for an unbelievable experience. Sitting on my own, I was ignored on 2 separate occasions, and when I finally spoke up, I was told that she is not used to seeing passengers sitting alone and therefore didn’t notice me. Nice! Drink orders had to be repeated more than once, and overall she seemed very unprofessional. I work in the airline industry and the fact that all window blinds as far as I could see were closed during taxiing and take off which I know for a fact is against DOT regulations. The fact that I paid such an outrageous amount of money for 2 business class seats for me and my wife on this decrepit airplane with sub standard inflight service is an absolute joke and Air Canada/Rouge should be ashamed."
Air Canada rouge,"✅Trip Verified| For an airline in a country that is all about inclusivity they make sure you know your place. No inflight entertainment, No wifi, Not even a USB port to charge your device. Did Air Canada have to special order a plane and ask for the USB ports to be removed? They also make sure to let you know what you are NOT getting in the announcements. The person making these announcements could be at least be a little humble or pleasant in their delivery. I get it, I was in economy, but some stuff like no USB port is Air Canada making sure to let you know you are in peasant class. Zero is not an option for the ratings, so where there is a 1 star, it is only because zero is not available and it should be as there was no entertainment or connectivity........or dare I say it, no USB port. Perhaps use this plane for cargo, wait! They are."
Air Canada rouge,✅Trip Verified|   Delayed on both ends due to ACs scheduling. Then on top of that sat on tarmac for 45 minutes for an unplanned maintenance issue. Then they deboarded and told us we would leave in an hour. Then than became 2 hours. So a 9:30pm flight was delayed to at least 2am. Nothing open so no food or water (not even vending machines) in the airport.
Air Canada rouge,"Not Verified| About a year ago my flight Toronto-Bogota was cancelled. Myself and probably other 200 people were lining up at the Air Canada customer service booth, to ask what to do. They closed the booth at 10pm and left myself and probably 100 people more stranded, with no information, no nothing. At the gate Air Canada employees were not able to provide any info/help either. I had to stay in Toronto's airport until next day, but still nothing. In the end I had to figure out how to get to my destination with no help from Air Canada. At that time I thought that was just a temporary thing, since I have been using Air Canada for over 2 decades with no regrets. Today, after a year, I am booking a flight using a travel advisor. She tells me that what happened to me last year is still happening to people today. That Air Canada continues to cancel flights left and right and leaves people stranded at the Airport in Toronto. That many of her clients have recently had the same experience I had a year ago."
Air Canada rouge,"Not Verified|   I had another unfortunate flying experience on Rouge from YYZ to Miami due to a cancelled Delta flight. Paid a premium booking a same day which is fine, however, I booked a comfort ticket and was given row 33D. I boarded zone 3, as one of the first passengers to board in the zone and was told I would have to check my bag. I asked if it was a gate check and they said yes you check it here and it goes to the carousel (not gate check by any airline definition). Sure enough, I arrive at my seat and the luggage bin is empty and remained so for the flight. I asked the flight attendant why this constantly happens and she said “we are volunteers before the flight and don’t get paid”. By itself, it’s really not a big issue, but when you are flying 2-3 times per week waiting an hour in every city is frustrating when there is capacity for bags on the plane. I flew about 10 times of 130 total flights last year on Rouge and each and every time there is some kind of service issue not too mention I was 2 for 10 on time vs. 2 delays out of a 100 flights on Delta (this flight was delayed for over an hour). Sad to see this airline deteriorate since the pandemic."
Air Canada rouge,"Not Verified|   I was very unsatisfied with the level of courtesy from flight attendants and staff. We landed in Montreal from our 4 hour flight a bit early on July 7th. So we were instructed to sit buckled in for 15-20 minutes. I had needed to use the washroom very bad. I had got up to use the washroom while we were stopped and waiting. The flight attendants seen me making my way to the back, no one stopped me. Until I was already at the washroom door, the flight attendant had pushed the door closed from my hand and very rudely told me to go sit down. I will not recommend this airline."
Air Canada rouge,"✅Trip Verified|  We travelled with our 6 month old baby and in Punta Cana they asked me and my family to return to the back of the line as they don’t allow early boarding with Infants. After explaining to the agent our situation she disregarded my request and asked me to go back to the line . After 10 minutes or so , another agent noticed us with the infant and asked us to go to the front of the line. Once we got to the front of the line, they made us wait until 90 percent of the plane boarded before letting us on board. Please note That my baby was screaming at this point. Please Also note that I was also traveling with my 77 year old Mother. Simply no respect. Not only we were almost one hour late for the departure from Punta Cana, once we got to Montreal they had no gate and didn’t how to get the passengers off the plane. They stated that we are waiting for Instructions. After 15 min they said we are going to get off the plane using a bus but no busses are available and another 10 min wait . Then the bus finally arrived but they made us wait in the stairs for 5 min for an unexplained reason.  During our departure from Montreal to Toronto we waited 3 hours in the airport because of bad weather that delayed the plane leaving from Toronto."
Air Canada rouge,"Not Verified|   We had an enjoyable flight experience with AC Rouge. The flight attendants on this crew worked very well together and demonstrated great cooperation and team work. The crew was welcoming, personable and professional. In particular, we enjoyed excellent service from Victoria and Heather."
Air Canada rouge,"✅Trip Verified|  My husband and I flew to Ft Lauderdale and returned to Toronto, for a Caribbean cruise. On both flights there was no food. The food trolley started with food but by the time it reached us, the food was all gone.  I told the attendant, but she just shrugged and said “sorry, all the food is gone”. Luckily I had purchased chips in the airport, but was really irritated that the food supply was so inadequate. The flights were smooth and pleasant otherwise."
Air Canada rouge,"✅Trip Verified|  Our flights from Houston to Quebec City were purchased on aircanada.com, and we reserved and paid for assigned seats for our traveling group of 6 (including family members, professional colleagues, and friends) on a single Air Canada booking reference. Upon arrival in Toronto, we were informed that our YYZ-YQB flight was delayed one hour because of a change of aircraft. It happens. But do note carefully: The change of aircraft was from one A321 to another A321. While one of Air Canada Rouge’s A321 may be configured slightly differently from another, the bulk of the seating is located in the economy section, and it is uniformly and predictably 6 across – 3 on each side of the center aisle. Perhaps the first-class section may be plus or minus a row or 2, which would result in the necessity of some changes of seat assignments in the economy section, but the overwhelming bulk of the seats and seat assignments need not be changed. Our assigned and paid-for seats were 19D, E, and F and 20 D, E, and F – all on the right side of the aircraft (by choice) and none were located in the front 2 rows of economy nor in the rear 2 rows of economy. As we boarded the gate agent informed us of a seat assignment change. One married couple in our group was seated together in the middle of the aircraft, but the rest of us were scattered throughout rear half of the economy section, with 5 of the 6 being in middle seats, including 3 of us in the middle seats of the last 3 rows of the aircraft. This is inexcusable. Why was our traveling-together-on-a-single-booking-reference group treated so disrespectfully? Perhaps 12 or so passengers of the entire aircraft may have needed to be moved, but why us, again I say traveling together as a group on a single booking reference? Because they could provide no explanation for the problem and were powerless to make it better, two Air Canada Rouge employees (the gate agent and a pilot!) suggested I raise the complaint."
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified|  We reserved seats in the exit row. This required us to declare that we were prepared to help in an emergency and that we understood English well. I declare the above. At the airport, we are asked if we speak French and we are told that we are being made to get out of our seats because our knowledge of French is insufficient. Our friends sitting on the other side of the plane, also in the exit row, are not asked anything and can simply keep our seats. I then ask for seats with more legroom, but this is not possible. Plus, we're 3 hours late. I absolutely do not recommend Air Caraibes.  Nous avons réservé des places dans la rangée de sortie. Cela nous obligeait à déclarer que nous étions prêts à aider en cas d'urgence et que nous comprenions bien l'anglais. Je déclare ce qui précède. A l'aéroport, on nous demande si nous parlons français et on nous répond qu'on nous fait lever de nos sièges parce que notre connaissance du français est insuffisante. Nos amis assis de l’autre côté de l’avion, également dans la rangée de sortie, ne se voient rien demander et peuvent simplement garder nos places. Je demande alors des sièges avec plus d'espace pour les jambes, mais ce n'est pas possible. De plus, nous sommes en retard de 3 heures. Je ne recommande absolument pas Air Caraïbes."
Air Caraibes,"Not Verified|  Vergognoso! Per risolvere qualunque cosa ti obbligano a chiamare il call center a pagamento. ( e avrete bisogno di loro sempre in quanto nulla può essere fatto in linea e hanno sempre problemi). Rilasciano buoni che non possono essere utilizzati online (ovviamente devi chiamare il call center), mandano link di pagamento che scadono in 2 ore e danno problemi sulla transazione ( ovviamente devi chiamare il call center). Assolutamente sconsigliati! - Shameful! To resolve anything they force you to call the paid call center. (and you will always need them as nothing can be done online and they always have problems). They issue vouchers that cannot be used online (obviously you have to call the call center), they send payment links that expire in 2 hours and give problems on the transaction (of course you have to call the call center). Absolutely not recommended!"
Air Caraibes,"Not Verified| I booked my flight with Air Caraibes to flight to Reunion through Paris in November 2019 using the travel agency Travel2Be. My flight was cancelled by the airline in late March. I receive a message saying that I can reschedule my flight for later. Then the situation with covid-19 got really bad and the EU issued a travel ban for all US citizens. I contacted Travel2Be to explain the situation to them and it took them a long time to reply saying that I have one year from the date of original purchase to use my tickets or I would lose them. I then tried to fill out a refund form on Air Caraibes. The site did not work and there was no email or number to contact them. I reply to the cancellation email, once again explaining the situation and asking them if they could extend the ticket to 2021. Their answer was use it by November 2020 or lose them. The airline cancelled the flight and this was out of their control but I also have not control over the travel ban. How are they expecting me to flight if I am banned from entering the EU and there are no end date for the ban? I have tried several emails and have received the same answer: use them by November or your lost. Best wishes. Are you kidding me? They basically took my money, didn’t provide any service and they won’t give it back. Both Travel2BE and Air Caraibes are horrible and dishonest companies. I will never ever use them or any companies associated with them. These companies are taking people’s money and then asking the government to bail them out. Who is going to bail the customer’s out? The customers who lost their money and probably have been affected greatly by the pandemic."
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified|  Our flight was canceled due to the Covid-19 issues, but from Air Caraïbes we never received mails concerning our canceled flight. Once we figured out ourselves, we were offered (by text on the website) to change date.  So in fact only the date that was affected was changeable, meaning our holiday was shortened by several weeks! Almost never did a new search for a reservation work. It was not available or simply not possible. No reason was given. You receive error messages in code (no text, but numbers with no explanation whatsoever) for whatever you try to do. They offer no help at all. The chat on the website is a robot that is not even capable of understanding what your question is and responded with answers we never asked for. Asking for help by phone is impossible and not even free. I already had to rebook my flight 4 times and every time the same mess again. Eventually since July they offer a refund in cash (to your credit card). Although I was legit for a full refund by reading the needed conditions on their site, once I submitted for the refund, I got a message saying that in my 'specific' situation I need to call Air Carraïbes for further assistance and predictable as I had read in many other reviews. No one is responding my call. In no way is it possible to get decent help or assistance and figuring out if everything is still in the running is all up to you to follow up your booking. For 2 of the rebookings I was going to receive a small refund of €21. Even today no refund was given. But in the cases where I had to pay a supplement, before realizing it, it was already taken from my credit card. As soon as you receive your new tickets with new dates, you receive a message in your account that dates are canceled or will not be available (again). It's terrible how they treat their customers. Never flown with them and never intend to in the future. To be clear, we have a ticket and booked a flight, but we were so far not able to fly, change dates or receive a refund or a better date to fly in the future. So our choice never to fly them in the future is because of the lack of a respectful customer service."
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified|  I had to fly with Air Caraïbes to Paris to connect back to Canada, as due to COVID there are no Canadian directs. I initially chose Air Caraïbes because the flight was ridiculously cheap, only €150 for a transatlantic flight! The airport and gate were typical for a mid-sized Caribbean airport - it had what I needed, but nothing more. When I first saw the plane, I realized how brand new it looked - it was an A350-1000. Getting on board, the modern feel of the cabin was obvious. I had a seat in the very back row, but still the seat was comfortable and it had above-average legroom. It came with your usual screen equipped with a good number of entertainment options. What really caught my eye with the screens, though, was the exterior cameras. I had a middle row, so it was amazing to still be able to watch the takeoff from a tailfin-mounted camera, and now I wish every plane had that! The food was excellent, there was only one option as far as I could tell but I did really enjoy the food, yet it was simple enough that most people would like at least some portion of it. Communicating with staff went fine with the basic amount of French I know as a Canadian, and anyone who complains about them not speaking English is obviously a little self-centred and doesn't realize that this is a local Caribbean airline serving only French locations, they shouldn't have to learn English to help out the 1 American traveller on a flight. Even with all of that, all of the gate announcements and in-flight announcements were also said in English, so I don't really get how this could be much of a problem. I will say that it was unfortunate that their main website had an English page but the booking screen was only in French, but again, I don't really hold it against them and got it booked with a little help from Google Translate. If you can't handle that, just book it from Expedia or something. All in all, this Air Caraïbes flight might just have been the best Economy experience that I've ever had, and I would definitely fly with them again, especially if the price stays that amazing!"
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified|  Pointe A Pitre to Paris. We bought our Business Class tickets, but actually we got only Premium Economy seats. I think the reasonable way to deal with it is to return the price difference to us."
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified| The worst airline ever! They don't speak English and rarely do they ever reply to you (and even if they do, that will be in French of course). Online check-in is fake - it doesn't work before the flight and they refuse to help you with that over the phone or email. Their employees at the airport are very unfriendly and completely unhelpful when met in person - you see that you are a burden for them when you need help at the airport. Besides, the airline lost my baggage and it can't be traced any more at all. Conclusion: if possible, try to avoid this terrible airline, it's the worst French airline for sure, low-costs show you more respect and understanding than this horrible airline. Don't fly them if you want a pleasant flight and good pre-/post-flight experience."
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified|  Paris to San Francisco. Extremely sketchy airline. They cancelled our flight back from Paris due to ""operational difficulties"" and said they could only book us on a flight 2 days later. They would not refund us the money for the flight even though they could not offer anything even close to what we booked. Their customer service just sent us in circles: call this number, call back tomorrow, submit a ticket here, email this address, call this other number. The company hides behind their phone reps, having them continuously say ""The company has issued a statement saying they will not refund anyone's money for the flight"". If you cancel a flight and can only replace it with a flight two days later you better give customers the opportunity to take a refund."
Air Caraibes,✅Trip Verified|  Pointe-à-Pitre to Paris Orly. Good service on this route in Classe Madras (business class). Flight took off and arrived on time. A good dinner was served shortly after take-off and a breakfast shortly before landing. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. However I have to say that I prefer the layout in the business class on their A330. The layout on this newer aircraft certainly has more functions but it looked quite cumbersome and crowded to me. Incredibly the selection of French songs was also very limited. Lounge in Pointe-à-Pitre was also quite small and very limited food ( good if you are on a diet as they were very slow to replenish the food supply ). Overall I think Air Caraïbes is good for this route but a few improvements can be made.
Air Caraibes,"✅Trip Verified|  Saint Martin to Paris Orly via Pointe à Pitre. Not an experience I'd like to repeat. First, my French isn't great so I had to find out at Pointe a Pitre that I needed to check in but I didn't need to pick up my hold baggage. So that meant I had 2 hours of queuing to check in, go through customs and security leaving it very fine to get my flight. Luckily, the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 so there was no rush. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised with continual announcements apologising for delays, calling babies, children, rows and a reminder that seats EFGH boarded through gate A, seats ABCD boarded through gate B. The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes, I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple puré/ baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed. I called customer service to try and upgrade my flight in the hope an upgrade would make the return journey less unpleasant. My french isn't great which I explained but the customer service girl lost patience and cut me off. I will never fly Air Caraïbes again."
Air China,"Not Verified|  I flew from Beijing to Geneva for over ten hours last week. Everything was ok, reasonable except for the toilets, which were filthy. Passengers used them all the time, and I don't think the flight attendants were cleaning them properly. I only used them once, and after that the whole flight I had to hold in the urge to pee, which was really bad."
Air China,"✅Trip Verified|   Both international planes were probably the dirtiest I have ever seen. To give you examples, the bathroom shelves were covered in dust and old hairs. The main ceiling looked like it had mould on it. The padding on the chairs (which did not look too old) was so thin that I could feel the plastic backing (much worse than Ryanair etc). The food was terrible - the cooked part was like something from a very cheap microwave meal. The server said they had run out of wine (this is an international flight!) and then when he opened the drawer, I saw a bottle unopened. I have flown many times in many countries in Asia but I’ve never heard a safety announcement spend time explaining how you could be arrested for various unknown crimes. International Air China flights have security agents walking around carrying cameras. I will never fly with them again and suggest nobody does."
Air China,"✅Trip Verified|   Outstanding Customer Service from Air China Jakarta Airport Ground Staff. On October 2nd, I arrived from Sydney to Jakarta (Qantas), planning to board (within 3.5 hours) on Air China (CA978) to Beijing (then to Madrid and Sao Paulo). Due to Qantas airplane problems, the Qantas flight arrived 2 hours late, leaving me with only 1:40 hours to board Air China. Unfortunately, Qantas refused to give any assistance to facilitate the very short time for check in. Talking to the Indonesia immigration agent, he called Air China ground staff, who sent an agent with a mission to help me(I did not have a Visa on Arrival, no boarding card and a checked luggage at Qantas.) The agent did everything to make me board the Air China flight, talked many times to the immigration officers, called Air China office to send a letter to the immigration and ran 6 times to the Air China counter to try to solve all bureaucratic issues. The agent and other Air China agents issued all documentation needed and ran with me and my luggage through Jakarta terminal be able to catch the flight. Boarding the Air China flight CA978 (in such a short time) was a small “miracle” that was possible because of the competence and excellent service of Jakarta’s Air China ground staff."
Air China,"✅Trip Verified|   Flight Booking and Customer Support: Everything was fine and we booked the tickets easily and hassle-free. The flight was only re-scheduled by 15 mins on our way there and 40 mins for our return flight from Athens to Beijing, which it was made up on the air and our flight landed even earlier than scheduled. The price was exceptional with the second cheapest ticket after that being nearly 60% more expensive. Online Check-In: My flight included two adults and one child, we flew from Melbourne to Athens via Beijing. The online check-in process was really bad, both times I did not manage to check in online because during the process, after reaching a point, then the buttons were not working, I have tried multiple from different computers and browsers and I did not manage to complete it, something must be wrong with the website. Be aware. Transit Layover: Air China has a Transit Hotel or Transit Lounge service. Unfortunately, again the website/app (I have tried both) was not very user-friendly and the information asked for the account creation was confusing and part of it was available only for Chinese residents. After a lot of struggle, again, the booking process reached a point where it was asking for the passport number but it did not accept it. I finally gave up and I booked a hotel nearby. Flight: The flight was much better than what we were expecting after reading all the bad reviews. I think for some of them, people had a bad experience with a long delay or they have been too picky because the ratings are not very fair. Back to the flight review. The seats' padding was a little bit thinner than what you can find in a similar aircraft of other airlines but not to the point that caused any inconvenience. The meals were a bit smaller but of decent quality, like any other flight meal. The crew members were frequently passing by asking the passengers if they wanted any drinks. The entertainment system was good with movies, some older some newer, games for the children, etc. Not the latest entertainment system or live sports games that you can find in other airlines, but good enough to keep you busy during the flight. The electronic conveniences were good, with proper touch-screen controls, a power outlet to charge your laptop and a USB charging port. Headphones and blankets were provided. Also, there is no wired remote attached to the seat, everything is controlled via the touch screen only. The internet wi-fi was there, but it wasn't. I did not manage to connect to any website at all, it was like there was no internet at all. The crew members were very polite and respectful. Their English were not perfect, but they could understand you 8 out 10 times. If you are not sure, just repeat and they will get it done. Overall, the value for money was 100% worthwhile, with airline ticket prices skyrocketing nowadays, if you are willing to sacrifice a fraction of convenience and you can live without the internet for a few hours, I would certainly recommend flying with Air China."
Air China,"Not Verified| Air China is horrible for people flying with allergies or dietary requirements. I am celiac and I flew Air China from Rome to Gaungzhou and back (with layovers) and requested a gluten allergy special meal, the meal was not fine as they put a piece of bread in it and to add onto it was an absolute fiasco to get! Online check-in does not offer you the option to book a special meal like many other airlines allow so you are constrained to call the number (which they do not answer) I am flying tomorrow back to Rome (a 15+ hour travel day) and will not be able to eat any food on the flight I will have to pack my own food. I am very disappointed with their online check as it does not work. It is such a horrible experience to fly with them!"
Air China,"✅Trip Verified| It wasn't very good flying by Air China. Their service was horrible, and they were stuck at the airport for 30+ hours. I feel no capacity to complaint when no internet access, no phone to dial hotline and no assistance for foreign passenger. Keeping people in air conditioned cold place without any blanket, and other necessary stuff."
Air China,✅Trip Verified|  The service and staff was excellent.  Welcomed with Hot towel and they laid out my slippers for me by my feet.  They showed us how to use the IFE and opened all the stuff wrapped in plastic ready for my use. Food and drink was served timely and mid way they would check on me and offer me snacks. The seats are very comfortable clean and spacious. It is rare i sleep in the plane but i was sleeping well in this plane. The blanket and pillow was like home. experience.
Air China,"✅Trip Verified|  Overall very pleasant surprise. Longhaul sectors (BUD-PEK) new aircraft, enough space, pleasant crew, 2 hot meals, constant service of drinks throughout the flight Shorthaul (3hours) quite old A330, hot meal, great crew. Generally the food is pretty great when from outstation and not good out of China (I ordered special meal, always received it) Also, entertainment options are quite poor - I would be so happy to watch some Chinese/Asian movies but there's no subtitles. Also, some sectors they make you switch off everything and even not use IFE 30 mins before landing. Confusing Had access to lounge on first sector which I didnt use, and free hotel on the way back (over 10 hours layover). You spend lots of time at immigration and getting to the hotel but those 5 hours at the hotel were priceless! Given the amazing price they usually offer I recommend."
Air China,"✅Trip Verified|  Have flown Air China from Italy to Japan twice (August 2023 and May 2024) with 3 layovers in Beijing and 1 in Hangzhou; a total of 8 individual flights. Overall, I would say it is a lower than average experience and quality that, generally, a traveller can rationalise away due to a good cost advantage, though this is not always the case and other airlines should be considered if not. I would draw a distinction between, 1) the flight itself, and 2) everything else around it like their website and booking system, online check-in and app experiences. The latter driving the overall experience way down due to what I believe is narrow browser compatibility (causing all sorts of problems in activating fields or multiple-selection drop-downs or even just page loading), cumbersome user interface, excessive 'prove you are not a robot' checks (some of which are actually broken and it is impossible to match in the way required, so you cannot proceed) and inexplicable, generic errors that stop you progressing. The check-in process is particularly frustrating and will require multiple attempts with different devices and browsers. The app simply did not work. Flight Experience: I would say average. Good points are that staff are generally helpful and pass frequently in the cabin to check things, also passing frequently with water. The aircraft I have flown on are an A350-9, B787-9 and 777 300-ER, the first 2 being new and the 777 being quite old and well-worn. Negative points are that the food is a little below average - generally chicken of beef with rice or noodles, but we did get a pork option on 1 flight. To my taste, the food is bland and uninspired. All meals come with a little salad/vegetable side, some bread product and a small sweet or fruit. The drinks cart passes about 10-20 minutes before the food, so don't drink everything before your food comes, though I did notice on my last 2 flights that they came with both drinks and food carts in tandem on the dinner service only. Interestingly, I felt the food on our short-hauls from Japan to China (both flights) were better that the long-haul from China to Italy. There are also no snacks offered whatsoever, so bring something with you if you get hungry easily. During the booking process and also later, it is 'possible' to select a non-standard meal like vegetarian or lactose-free. I selected lactose free on all flights, but this was only satisfied on a single leg of 1 journey (so 2 flights). Thankfully, there isn't much cream/milk in Chinese cuisine, so I had no problem. In the cabin, none of our flights had individual air control at the seat, so you are at the mercy of the overall cabin temperature - I found a couple of flights to be very warm and uncomfortable. I found this the worst aspect of the flight. Trim and materials on all aircraft are basic. The IFE on the 350 and 787 were decent, but the 777 is old with small screens that are often very washed-out and have a very poor touch experience - I always reverted to using the physical controller. Content library is 80% Chinese to 20% western and not very large in any case. No real Wifi on board. English can be a bit hit-or-miss and oftentimes the English PA announcements were completely incomprehensible - thankfully, nothing really important is ever said on any flight PA - but speaking face-to-face is better."
Air China,"Not Verified|   My flight was delayed due to bad weather and it was already clear that I will miss my connective flight (the same for many other passengers). I know that the weather is not the airline's fault, but the unprofessional handling is. Although CAN is an international airport, nobody at Air China CAN speaks English. And even after passengers arranged their own translator, they were not willing to talk to us. Instead of organizing a rebooking and give passengers certainty about how the trip will continue, they did nothing and kept us uninformed until we reached the next stop in the middle of the night. It was barely impossible to plan ahead and inform people waiting for us. Writing a complaint is pointless. The customer service only referred to the weather, but did not address the actual reason for my complaint (staff not willing to talk to passengers and help them rebooking). But this was not the only issue on my trip. My flight should have included Wi-Fi, which was a major criterion for my choice. But it was broken and the airline refuses to compensate for it. After a complaint, they only ""confirm that it was broken"" (yeah, I know that, this is why I contacted them), but ""they cannot compensate, thanks for understanding"". No, I do not understand that you find it natural to charge the full price although you confirm that part of the service was not provided."
Air Corsica,"✅Trip Verified|  Air Corsica handled my delayed bag terribly. At Bastia airport 40 people waited up to 1 hour to be seen by a baggage claim agent. MY 50 minute wait plus the 35 minutes spent filling out forms meant there were no more airport buses or taxis available to the city. An additional wait for a taxi brought me to my hotel 2 plus hours late. I had to waste even more time buying replacement items needed till my bag would arrive the next day. And the Air Corsica site for reclaiming these expenses was unusually user unfriendly, illogical, and demanding unreasonable amounts of documents. Once submitted I received a message saying that because of the high volume of demands there would be a 6 week delay for a response! There was never an apology or explanation for the delayed bag. Air Corsica is stuck in another century in terms of customer service."
Air Corsica,"Not Verified|  We were expected to travel from London and Paris to Calvi, all booked together on family holidays. Air Corsica suspended all flights from London giving only two weeks’ notice and did not accept to refund tickets from the third passenger travelling from Paris. The third passenger could not travel alone, and we also had to cancel accommodation and car rental resulting in additional costs incurred. Extremely poor customer service, many emails and phone calls since September. Lots of time and money lost and extremely high frustration."
Air Corsica,"✅Trip Verified|  You can change your seats at e-check in without charge. Both flights were on time. A320neo was clean, there were no inflight service for the 1 hour flight. Stewards were efficient and friendly enough."
Air Corsica,"✅Trip Verified|  Bastia to Stansted. Group of 8 flying as a family. At check-in, Air Corsica staff mixed up baggage tags so they did not correspond to the correct individual. Air Corsica then decided not to load a full trolley of luggage on to the flight to ensure it was not delayed. 4 out of 8 bags did not arrive at Stansted within our family (alongside numerous other families that were also missing bags). We proceeded to inform staff but as the luggage tags were on incorrect bags due to incompetent staff, we could not make it as clear as it should have been on the missing bag forms. 3 out of 4 bags arrived within 5 working days. Our bag has never been recovered. Air Corsica have then proceeded to make it impossible to track it down or receive a refund for lost luggage. Website does not allow you to save or upload correct information so 4 times we had to restart our request. They refuse to speak English on the phone. After we finally processed the refund request, they sent one reply saying the bag had been returned and therefore the case was closed. They then closed the request without even contacting us and so we therefore had no way of appealing this. The bag has never returned. We have now had to go through our insurance provider but even this is being made difficult as they aren't even able to get hold of Air Corsica and as our luggage tags were incorrect we are having to speak to multiple insurance providers that we took insurance out with even though it only affected one of us.  We flew in September 2019, are now in February 2020 and are still trying to receive compensation for our luggage."
Air Corsica,"✅Trip Verified|  Stansted to Ajaccio. Excellent all round. On time, drink and a snack served, no hassle to board or have onboard bags. Seats were comfy for a 2 hour flight - fare reasonable. Would recommend."
Air Corsica,"✅Trip Verified|  I flew from Marseille to Ajaccio. Overall I was satisfied. The outbound leg was carried out with an ageing but very well kept ATR 72, and the return with a recent A320. Both flights were on time and the crew was polite and smiling. Given the short duration of the flights, both around 50 minutes, the inflight service consisted solely of drinks, but that's fine. The basic fare always includes a checked in luggage and the price was correct: I spent 118 euros return to fly on mid-July booking just 4 weeks prior to departure. The only minus was the long waiting time to collect the luggage at AJA (25 minutes despite having just 2 aircrafts to unload), but I don't blame it on Air Corsica."
Air Corsica,"✅Verified Review|  Flight XK101 on December 25th. Like every year going back home, there were long queues at the check-in counters due to understaffed service on Christmas Day, which caused a 30 minute boarding delay for just a 40 minute flight. Aircraft was as tight as usual. 100% full. Don't expect much from this flight which is just a hop across the Med. Onboard crew is OK, but ground staff are slow. Propeller aircrafts are very noisy. Service onboard is 1 drink. But, most of all is how can the airline justify such a high price 190 Euros (non flexible tickets) round trip for only 2x 40min flights. Prices are more expensive than ever despite the very low cost of fuel."
Air Corsica,"On September 4th 2015, we had reservations to fly Air Corsica from Calvi to Nice. Then we had connection on Alitalia to Rome. Our connections were very tight with only 45 minutes in Nice. Weather on September 4 created much confusion. The Air Corsica flight from Nice to Calvi was delayed 1 hour and arrived at 10:45am. We were going to miss our Nice to Rome connection. We expected to be staying the night in Nice. We departed Calvi 1/2 hr late. Fortunately, the flight from Nice to Rome was also delayed. The Air Corsica agents in Calvi arranged for an agent in Nice to assist in having my wife and I meet Alitalia agent. That agent escorted us through security to our gate and we made the Nice/Rome connection. We arrived in Rome only 1/2 hour late and all of our bags (4) arrived perfectly."
Air Corsica,Short hop from Nice to Calvi. Hardly any people onboard. Crew were not particularly friendly or welcoming but we were served a cookie and soft drinks. Landed smoothy although slightly delayed due to a missed approach. However tickets were cheap and luggage included. All in all a decent experience.
Air Corsica,A good trip. I did Paris-Orly-Calvi and Calvi-Marseille. These trips were fairly good staff at the airport and cabin crew where very good. Biscuits and a drink served onboard (totally normal for the time of the flight which is not longer than one hour and a half). However the seat was really small.
Air Costa,"Bangalore to Hyderabad. My first time with Air Costa – they been operating as a regional airline India for 2 years. A great experience, the legroom was really good, seats comfortable and the aircraft very new. It's low cost, so besides a glass of water, it costs. But given the flight time of little over an hour that's no problem. The range of food and beverages looked good though. The flight was 20 mins late – the only downside."
Air Cote d'Ivoire,"✅Trip Verified|  A dreadful experience all the way. Started at Conakry airport where I was told the time of the flight had been changed for 2 weeks but no notice where sent to passengers even business class even if it is possibly the most expensive ticket I have ever bought related to the number of miles flown. So 4 hours of unnecessary wait. The seat was nothing better than adequate and the cabin crew did not care about me even if I was the only passenger in Business class, easy to understand why! No meal offered on a more than 2 hours flight, only luke warm ordinary champagne served in the kind of soft plastic ""glasses"" you find in office water fountains. Horrendous experience when I connected in Abidjan: all passengers had to walk several hundred yards on the tarmac in the middle of vehicles and planes, with no staff to assist, even on a security standpoint. On the second leg, zero service, zero meal, zero drink. Horrible experience."
Air Djibouti,"✅Trip Verified| Boarding was by bus, departure on time. Plane was in a good condition. There was a limited IFE through your mobile, adequate for such a hour flight. Inflight service was a bottle of water. There was buy MENU available."
Air Djibouti,"✅Trip Verified|  Hargeisa to Djibouti. Air Djibouti operates one single Boeing 737-500, leased with crew from a company in Tajikistan, as well as, reportedly, a few smaller aircraft. We flew from Hargeisa to Djibouti in November. The plane had arrived from Mogadishu with a delay but landed in JIB almost on time. It was definitely at least 25 years old but appeared to be in a very good state of repair. Seats were tight but comfortable. Catering consisted of a single bottle of water, which was ok on this 40-min hop. Okay was also our general impression."
Air Dolomiti,"✅Trip Verified| Let’s start off by saying I paid 2000€ for a one way economy class ticket from Italy to South Africa with 2 layovers. Delayed connecting flights however resulted in me arriving 12 hours after the initial arrival time, WITHOUT my suitcases, after being re issued tickets for different flights. Upon doing some research about compensation illegibility I decided to get in touch. I sent incessant emails for 2 months and after no reply, hope dwindled. I finally received a reply after my last mail turned nasty. Thereafter, each email started by apologizing for the delay because the waiting time for a response was laughable. 3 Months later and I have still not received a cent… I have likely given up by now, which means they have won, and this was likely their intended outcome from the start."
Air Dolomiti,"✅Trip Verified|  Over the past 2 years, I have flown at least 10 times for work. My husband also frequently travels via this route, separate from me, for his job. We assume that this flight will be late, and plan accordingly. We have both had horrible experiences with missed connections, as Lufthansa/Air Dolomiti cannot provide proper customer service (for hotel, re-imbursements, etc) at Munich or Frankfurt airports. I should have known better. In March 2023, 2 bags were checked in Toronto. I tracked both bags via the Air Canada app until Frankfurt, so I know that both arrived. Of course, connection in Frankfurt was three hours late. Once I did arrive in Turin, one of the bags was missing. There were three other people in line that day with missing bags.  4 days later my bag was delivered to my home. Suitcase was damaged, the lock broken off, and items missing! I will now be avoiding Lufthansa + Air Dolomiti as there are more reliable options. Customer service center rep in Albania was extremely kind and reassuring. Italian counter-parts, not so much. In all fairness, the flights are not bad with clean aircraft, free water, and pleasant/multilingual airline attendants."
Air Dolomiti,"Not Verified|  I flew multiple times with them, not a single flight on time. The company is the only connection from minor airports of Italy to Lufthansa Flights, so there is no alternative, but Lufthansa should be ashamed of collaborating with them."
Air Dolomiti,Not Verified|  A to B and that's all. I was pleased to see that the Embraer aircraft on this route was not as noisy as I remembered from years ago. The senior crew were grumpy and avoided eye contact or any interaction with passengers.
Air Dolomiti,"✅Trip Verified|  Lufthansa Frequent Flyer here. You will see a previous review from me entitled ""Seems to be late quite a lot"", under the surname Weber. Good news: Air Dolomiti (owner: Lufthansa) is still late on my travels. This time, it was only 30 minutes! They are improving. Excuse: ""We left Frankfurt late"". The problem is that Air Dolomiti connects me to my international flights, so when they are late, they have no time to transfer my luggage from the their small jet onto the connecting flight's jet. The result: 3 out of the last 6 of my international flights have had my luggage not arrive at the destination airport. Verified that in each case that they were not loaded from Air Dolomiti to Lufthansa plane due to no time because of late arrival. Yes, Air luggage delayed so often is sure helping Lufthansa frequent flyers. (both owned by same group.) Air Dolomiti is still late."
Air Dolomiti,"✅Trip Verified| Lost Luggage. AirTag showed bag remained in Florence with the carrier for 7 days. Staff is not passionate and it shows. Stone faced and rather rude gate agents. Very lacklustre. Worse than a US based low cost carrier. On the plus side, the aircraft was clean."
Air Dolomiti,"Not Verified|  Nice surprise, as an Italian I appreciated a lot the food which could be bought on board (Pasta alla Norma & Red wine Valpolicella). Professional and friendly staff, tasting and authentically Italian food. Proud as Italian to feel these kind of attentions to flyers. Strongly suggested."
Air Dolomiti,"✅Trip Verified| Air Late-omiti. Am a Lufthansa Frequent Traveler, and always have to use Dolomiti for connections to Frankfurt. Yesterday, late arrival. Had to run through the airport to make my connection. In the last 32 sectors over the past 18 months, Dolomiti has been late quite a lot on my travels. Cannot figure out why they even bother to hand out single postage-stamp sized cookie or the single square of chocolate. Why bother? It's just a token, and not a useful one in my opinion. Better to just not hand out anything instead of that fattening little single bite of food. Secondly, staff uniforms seem strange to me: a business suit with a golf shirt underneath and no tie. Third, the pilots tend to keep the seat belt sign on for entire flights, even when there is no turbulence. Furthermore, may I suggest that they review the appearances of their crew: have seen a captain with shoulder length 'surfer-dude' hair - good for surfers - maybe not so good for somebody with a wings badge on their chest."
Air Dolomiti,"✅Trip Verified| This company is only good at finding excuses for being late and putting its passengers into trouble. They are always late. And when you arrive no stairs, no bus, nobody to unload luggage."
Air Dolomiti,✅Trip Verified| The worst experience ever! Flight Florence-Frankfurt was canceled half an hour before departure! We were already on the gate. Had to go back and wait 5 hours at the airport until the airline rerouted the flight. They decided to fly us from Verona. We waited hours for the bus then they book us a cheap ugly dirty hotel where they put us in the rooms a bag with disgusting sandwiches. They didn’t arrange for our transfer from hotel to airport next day. We had to pay for the taxi! Never again with this airline!
Air Europa,"✅Trip Verified| The customer service is beyond terrible. The check in process at the Lisbon Airport was atrocious. Three clerks with over one hundred people in line. We were at the airport 3 hours early and still almost missed our flight. Very stressful day. AFTER the flight, the customer service regarding getting a simple copy of my invoice has been a nightmare. I have been put on hold for over an hour TWICE before being disconnected. I have written emails and then being told to reach them through Facebook or Twitter. Completely getting the runaround. My head is ready to explode."
Air Europa,✅Trip Verified|   As a gold elite plus holder I can use the Madrid lounges. The trip was uneventful until I got to Madrid airport having to wait one hour in a passport queue. Then attempting to enter the puerta del sol lounge where the receptionist seemed to have taken on the role of an autocratic authoritarian prison guard. The police checking passports are far more pleasant and civil they are decent people. Where AENA recruits it staff from I have no idea but they must treat them really badly if they are this nasty.
Air Europa,✅Trip Verified|   Usual poor service. Only booked with Air Europa to use up my air miles. They cancelled my seat reservations made at time of booking. They never explained but I guess because by the time of flight my status has changed from elite plus to elite. Always good to see their ability at annoying their regular customers is at its finest once again. I would recommend they do not serve food as it is revolting and just adds to the perception of them taking their customers for mugs.
Air Europa,"✅Trip Verified|   I would strongly recommend avoiding this airline.  I flew London to Tunisia and back. On the way there the staff were abrupt and fairly rude to passengers, the arm rest was broken with wires from the media controls sticking out of it. Same  staff attitude on the return, and this time the seat was stuck in an uncomfortable position and the armrest wouldn’t lift (making it awkward to get in and out of the seat. The plane was so loud I thought it was damaged But, all of that I can ultimately let slide because it was cheap and it got me where I wanted to go. But the worst part if my luggage was damaged in transit - the handles were broken and now only served as ornaments and the built in lock was ripped off. I reported this at the airport, filled in the relevant stuff and provided images before leaving the baggage claim. About 3 weeks later they wanted more images and details of the damage I claimed as well as an invoice for my purchase of the suitcase. After replying, another few weeks passed and they then wanted an image of the baggage tag, proof of the ticket, again wanting the invoice of purchase of the bag, as well as a ‘certificate’ from a luggage store/company confirming the value of my suitcase and confirming that it can’t be repaired. Its now September and I’ve not heard more from them"
Air Europa,"Not Verified| This sadly wasn't the first time I've flown Air Europa, and necessity means I'll have to do at least one more flight but hopefully that will be it. It's difficult to begin where to start, and to be frank there are so many failings that listing them would be a rather long process so I'll keep it brief. My last flight was long haul (Gatwick to Córdoba, Argentina via Madrid) and in Business Class. This is supposedly a low cost carrier and the standard in all respects but one is indeed low cost; comfort, food, cabin crew etc. The one thing which wasn't low cost was the price, it was more expensive than similar airlines such as Air France and KLM the other carriers I've previously used and been happy with. I suppose other than the truly uncomfortable seats the worst aspect was the cabin crew. I've rarely seen such self-serving people in the service industry. On this latest flight there was literally one person who seemed to enjoy her job, a young lady who was helpful and with a smile. The male attendants ranged from being uninterested to almost overtly aggressive. Others have pointed out the practical failings and lack of comfort of the actual planes so I'll leave that but in all honesty this airline should be your last resort. I had hopes that the proposed takeover by IAG would turn it around but that seems to have come to an end with the business pulling out of the deal."
Air Europa,"✅Trip Verified|  Early morning flight with chaotic boarding process. Rude ground staff with really poor attitude. Excellent new aircraft with comfortable business cabin. Unprofessional cabin crew with zero interest in providing a decent service. Mediocre business class breakfast served as you didn't deserve it. Any interaction with the cabin crew seemed to bother them. Cabin crew acted like they were more interested in criticizing each other than taking care of their customers. I've been observing how their service has been gradually deteriorating in the last months. Flight was at least on time. After six years at the highest level of their frequent flyer program, I'm seriously considering flying other airlines."
Air Europa,"✅Trip Verified|  The deterioration in service standards with Air Europa continues. The flight was 2.5 hours late. I cannot tell you why, as neither the flight nor cabin crew felt it necessary to explain or apologise for the delay. But as always in summer in Spain the weather was perfect all day. Air Europa is an airline that relies on connections to its hub in Madrid to other destinations and so some passengers on board this flight would have inevitability missed their connection. Given this the crew’s silence is all the more extraordinary. But more importantly it led to an increase in frustration in passengers and a scuffle broke out as desperate passengers scrambled to disembark to get their connecting flight. The crew showed no capacity for professionalism or attempting to diffuse the understandable frustration that accrued by 1) the delay, and 2) failure by the crew to apologise or mention it. This is not the first time that I have observed flight or cabin crew failing to control threats to passenger safety and I now simply question whether this airline is safe to fly with at all. It is certainly not worthy of clients given the contempt it shows them."
Air Europa,"✅Trip Verified|  The worst airline with the worst staff at the Terminal 1 of Madrid. I don’t recall to be more embarrassed by someone in my life, but when I was trying to board the second plane on my way to London in Madrid. My friend and me were traveling from Punta Cana already and had a stop in Madrid before heading back home in London. We were absolutely tired and we were the last people to board the plane even though we arrived there with 3 hours in advance. When it was our turn, a member of the ground staff told us to check our cabin bags because the flight was full and there was no space. We told him we rather not do it as we were tired and my friend was sick we wouldn’t be able to spend more time waiting for the bags. This worker shouted at us straight away and said that this is mandatory, which I replied to not to shout at me, then he was shouting around saying that he will ban me from Air Europa.  He then asked if my friend speaks Spanish which we said no, then he started to insult her in Spanish and telling us off. I made big complaints about this situation and nothing has been solved. I would rather not to travel anymore than flying with Air Europa."
Air Europa,"Not Verified|   My trip from Lisbon to Las Palmas through Madrid was made hellishly difficult by the complete incompetence of every employee that I had the misfortune of running in to - air staff excluded. I had to call their ""customer support"" because they insisted i paid extra for my luggage for each leg of the return journey. It took 9 days With numerous daily attempts to get through. The App experience is directly embarrassing. It is slower than a painful death and crashes constantly. It also randomly changes your user language making it de facto useless, and to top off that, they insisted that I checked My hand luggage and then sent it to the wrong destination. Their ground support in Madrid airport should be fired without warning! How on earth a modern company can get the truly idiotic idea to hire airport staff who doesn't speak English is beyond me. I highly recommend everybody to stay clear of Air Europa. The one up side i will concede was that they at least managed to get us to the ground safely and on time."
Air Europa,"Not Verified|   I had a bad experience with my carry on going up and down ramps and airplane steps. I was exhausted just moving around with my carry on, and on my return i was force to check in my carry as not to go through it all again. I had to pay $165.00 which was ridiculously high. My return was worse after plane landed again those outdoor steps and bus then had to walk about 45 minutes to my connecting flight i was so exhausted. This airline is for young people, no way of knowing ahead of time. I would not recommend this airline."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified| I booked AF with an impression that it is one of the best airlines in the world. However, to my utter disappointment this airlines lacks all the service parameters that it should have. 1. Customer Service: While checking in at the airport counter at yyz I was with my newborn and was looking for an assistance to help with my luggage and getting a boarding pass but I was left on my own to do things and the ground staff was busy on their phone. Once I completed my checking the staff comes and shamelessly asking for a review. (I would have better complained but didnot wanted to escalate the situation) 2. Airline Crew: While I was managing my baby in a bassinet the airline crew was absolutely uncooperative and infact gave a hard stare when confronted as if they wish they could throw me out of the plane. the most ridiculous, unprofessional and Impatient crew i have ever come across 3. Baggage compensation: My bags were damaged and beyond repair. I was looking for a compensation but I was given a dummy number and email address to contact and get my bag repaired which never worked and they closed my case inspite of repeated followups Overall: A bad experience with Air France and not recommending any one to fly with AF."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   Air France has the best customer service ever! Our flight to Tel Aviv was cancelled due to the situation in the middle east, and air France phone center did everything possible to find us a different route. Because the only airline that flew was El Al, all the flights were fully booked, so we called a couple of times to Air France customer service until we managed to book a new seat from Rome to Tel Aviv, even though the connection should have been from Paris. Air France moved our flight 1 day forward, added a flight to Rome, and booked the El Al tickets without additional cost (the tickets were super expensive on the website) To add to it all, the service was in Hebrew which was extremely convenient! Would fly again"
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   Our experience with Air France in Detroit Airport in May 2024 was appallingly unprofessional from start to finish. We were informed a couple days before our departing flight that our flight was delayed by a day. As people who have traveled extensively, we understand that this is not uncommon, but the way Air France handled the rescheduling of our flight was tumultuous to say the least. In order to get our returning flight pushed back a day (so we would not lose an entire day from our trip) we had to contact multiple people online and over the phone, wasting hours with unhelpful customer service. But we eventually managed to move our returning flight and confirm our departing flight. Being concerned about how that situation was handled, I called Air France to make sure our flight was confirm two days before our departing flight. We were assured multiple times that our flight and seats were confirmed. However, when we arrived at the Detroit airport, I was told by someone who worked for Air France that my flight was not only unconfirmed, but that she had noticed my ticked was unconfirmed 24 hours ago and was “wondering and waiting for me to confirm” my flight. When I asked why I never received a call or email to confirm my flight since she was curious about my flight status herself, the agent just shrugged her shoulders and laughed. The agent began to show animosity toward me at this moment because she must’ve taken my question as an insult (despite it being a valid question). The agent continuously said that because my flight was unconfirmed, they likely gave the seat to someone else and it would now be impossible for me to get on that flight. She said she would look to check the flight but gave the impression there was nothing she could do now. Amidst my sudden panic attack, the agent proceeded to tell my girlfriend that she can get my girlfriend onto the flight without me and that my girlfriend should leave me behind and get on the flight. The agent  could not have cared less about my situation or the urgency of the matter.  Luckily my girlfriend and I were finally able to get onto our flight. I have never received such poor and unprofessional service from anyone."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   Never had such a horrible experience with an airline. At the beginning i could not check in online. I have never experienced such unfriendly, impolite and unprofessional staff."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified| Without any explanation given by the ground staff the passengers had to wait one hour before they could embark. But once on board some of them were rudely asked to place their hand luggage in the hold as there was no room for it on board.  Surprisingly, when we landed to Tbilisi I discovered that there were empty spaces in the luggage compartments - it’s just that the crew decided to shut them quickly even before all passengers embarked. So, we had 30 minutes delay again.  The dinner was a joke. A tiny sandwich and a cracker for a 4:30 flight.  My neighbors wanted to have an extra bottle of wine. But the attendant responded that they already had three of them and that enough is enough!  And as Air France is still using their old A-320, no inflight entertainment!"
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   I have previously flown Business Class on Air France and thought it was excellent. Unfortunately this trip in their Premium Economy was not worth it, even allowing for different expectations. First, I rang to tell them that I was bringing 2x kitesurf bags. Their policy permits this provided you tell them at least 48 hours in advance (which I did, ringing 6 days prior). They flat out refused to take the second bag saying ""the hold was full"" (of cargo presumably). I pointed out I was flying for the sole purpose of kitesurfing and without the requisite equipment the holiday was ruined and the flight pointless.  The flight from LHR to CDG was fine. We were given a nice sandwich. The problem started on the CDG > GRU leg an 11 hour overnighter on a 777. The plane was shabby and old. There was no pre dinner drinks service with the drink served at the same time as the main meal - not what you want on an 11 hour flight departing in the evening. They had run out of Premium Economy food so I got Economy food and mine was disgusting - miserable and tasteless. My travelling companion got the Premium Economy meal which was almost as bad (there is it seems virtually no difference). The worst bit by far is the seat which does not recline and is as hard as a rock. Indeed the seat on the A220 for the 40 minute flight from London in economy was better than this seat. Truly terrible. On the return leg it was virtually impossible to check in to Gol (their Brasilian in country partner) as the Air France ticket locator code is not recognised on the Gol website. On GRU to CDG flight we at least got a drinks service. But the food was just as bad as before. I was offered a drink after the meal that was served in a cardboard cup. The seat was still like lying on a rock. Again no sleep possible on an overnight flight. Security going to the K gates was a lengthy and stressful mess. I realise this is not Air France's fault; but it is part of the Air France experience since that is where you have to change planes, so is relevant if you are thinking of booking. Overall the extra charged for their ""premium economy"" is simply not worth it. Things they need to do to fix it: 1. Live up to their promise and actually take your sports equipment instead of prioritising cargo. 2. Update their planes (the 777 was ancient) 3. Provide a proper drinks service 4. Upgrade the food 5. Upgrade the seats so they are comfortable and recline a bit, so you can sleep. 6. Make sure AF locator codes work on partner airlines for checkin 7. Get CDG airport to speed up the security process for transfers."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified| I very much enjoyed this trip in premium economy. The seats are wider compared to economy with just 8 seats per row instead of 10. Everyone gets their own armrests on both sides. The seat recline is generous and the seat is built in a way that allows for a couple of hours of sleep. The premium economy cabin is separated by a wall and curtains from the economy cabin. This allows for a cosy feeling in a small cabin of just six seat rows. The entertainment screen and system are up to date. The headphones provided are fixed to the seat. Alternatively, you could pair your own headphones through Bluetooth, which worked flawlessly. The food quantity and quality on the other hand falls short. On the 13 hour flight to Paris, only one meal was served just after take off. The crew occasionally distributes snacks and tiny sandwiches. There's another hot snack before landing. Better to stock up on snacks and a bottle of water in the convenience store after security at the airport. The premium economy tickets gives access to Sky Priority benefits in the airport and allows you to board in group 2, ahead of most passengers in economy class. At Seoul Incheon Airport, there were sadly no provisions for Sky Priority lanes for security and passport control. The queues were quite long but everything was handled efficiently."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   Our experience at NCE SkyPriority check-in was the worst. We were denied to board an earlier flight from NCE to CDG, that we requested as our connection in CDG was very short. Despite the fact that seats were available and we would have accepted to be downgraded to ECO on that flight, the staff denied arguing that our tariff did not allow. It was not true as we checked later. In CDG we had to rush between terminals, due to the late arrival of our aircraft, cross immigration etc.; we were the last pax to board. On the other side A350 new Business class seats are great (especially front row), food was delicious, and staff top notch. Wine selection was not interesting unfortunately. France has much better to offer. Note that Wi-Fi was not available which is very annoying."
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   Our trip was from Bilbao to Houston via Paris. Air France departed late from Bilbao (no weather issues) we arrived in Paris to board our leg to Houston, Tx and when we get to the gate after running from one terminal to the other, they did not allow us to board even though the plane was there. Even after begging, the staff still decided. We were sent the next day via Detroit / Austin. The vouchers we got were not accepted at the places we tried. All the airline staff, except for one person were adamant. Avoid flying with Air France!!"
Air France,"✅Trip Verified|   Check-in at BOS was quick, no-frills. Air France lounge needs a strong refurbishing as everything is worn-out. However good choice of wines and food. Very comfortable new seats (I recommend 1D for instance); Unfortunately night flight service was disappointing, with many food options lacking, and a one-tray service including appetizer, cheese, and desert (economy class type), that could not be a standard for a long-haul Business Class. Champagne was fine, but I would not rate wines at premiums. Crew did the job, only the job. We docked in a remote position in CDG, had to walk 100 meters under strong rain as the bus remained far away; how can this be ?"
Air Greenland,"✅Trip Verified|  The product offered by Air Greenland is vastly different between their A330 jet service from Copenhagen and their propeller Dash 8 flights within Greenland. My overall rating covers my entire experience. The A330 to and from Copenhagen was actually very good. Nice modern aircraft, very friendly crew, decent cold meal service and 2 drink services. Seat back entertainment but no headphones provided or sold so remember to take your own standard headphones with a small jack connection. I'd rate that part as 4 stars out of 5. The internal Air Greenland Dash 8 planes were basic and tired inside, no entertainment and only a drink offered. Tighter seating but friendly staff, I'd rate that as 3 star. The onboard experience all in all was ok but its the behind the scenes I have issue with. Firstly with the 4 flights we had, I had around 10 schedule changes before departure between 15 mins and a few hours, so really need to keep an eye on them. My biggest annoyance was both cases were damaged but as it was the zipper lock mechanism smashed it was deemed the wrong type of damage for them to offer any assistance. Both cases are unusable without repair but Air Greenland aren't interested at the airport or at their customer relations centre. So taking that into account I rate as 2 out of 5 overall."
Air Greenland,"✅Trip Verified|  No issues. Decent meal. Good entertainment. The domestic flights inside of Greenland don’t have any food or entertainment, but this one long haul route does. Would fly again."
Air Greenland,"Not Verified|  First of they attributed to me and my husband 2 seat, each one at the opposite of the plane. We had to wait plenty of time for luggage drop. I am traveling all over the world with my camera and lenses in my backpack and a trolley containing all important stuff like medicines and so. Especially in these times when luggage are more than sometimes lost. Today was the first time they ask money to send my trolley.... I really hope it will land with me. Also the staff even didn't try to help or to be comprehensive. And of course there was no responsible person to talk to. And no time was left. So we had to pay. I think it is unacceptable. Even the Stewardess was not a nice person. When the company is not positive, everything is bad. I will never travel with them again."
Air Greenland,"✅Trip Verified|  I booked my ticket at Air Greenland's website in Dec 2019 for a planned holiday in Sept 2020. Small planes and infrequent flights, thought I'd better book early. So much has happened since then with Covid. I'm trying to refund or rebook this expensive ticket - they point-blank refused. First they said they were not processing any ticket changed dated after 31 Aug, and asked me to contact them again in mid Aug. Now they said since my ticket was not bought after Apr 2020, they will not rebook/refund! I am not even allowed in Denmark, how am I supposed to take the flights? Most airlines offer free refund or rebooking of international flight tickets. Not Air Greenland!"
Air Greenland,"✅Trip Verified|  Nuuk to Copenhagen. Just a short comment. Way too expensive, for obviously no other reason but pure arrogance because they are the only company flying into or out of Greenland and they think they can do whatever they want. Nonstop technical errors, and constant danger of missing other flights because of them. If there were ANY other options to fly in or out of Greenland i would choose it over Air Greenland. I feel robbed and furious every time i have to give them my money."
Air Greenland,✅Trip Verified|  Copenhagen to Maniitsoq. One of the worst airlines. Very bad customer service both on board and at the airports. They don't take of you or your luggage and they don't take responsibility for anything - it is always the others responsibility.
Air Greenland,"✅Trip Verified| Flew Air Greenland from Copenhagen to Ilulissat via Kangerlussuaq. Way too expensive in relation to the journey length. Long queue on check-in at Copenhagen Airport. Seems to lack any service minded and professional customer service skills. Using terminal 3 for check-in would be preferable than terminal 2. The A330 was old and indeed outdated, a new interior or replacement of the transatlantic aircraft is needed. There is no Wi-Fi onboard, quality of the food was bad, very poor and old in-flight entertainment. 1 movie was shown and a few playlists were on, there were problems with their entertainment system, it to be reset some times before it worked. There is a very off-hand attitude among the staff, not least on board the transatlantic flight. Seriously, they don't seem to care about their customers! Though the short flight on the small Dash 8, was better. Arriving Copenhagen Airport, the waiting time for your luggage can be very long, this can take as long as up to 1 hour after arrival. Overall I would not fly this airline again if there was other alternatives."
Air Greenland,"✅Verified Review|  Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq. I purchased a Business Class ticket over 9 months in advance. It was confirmed and I was assigned a seat. I even got Boarding Passes the day before the flight for my wife and I. But on the day of the flight I was told I had no seat while my wife did. Air Greenland overbooked and to solve the problem they did not select someone who bought last, but the one who paid more. Odd and unique logic as the person who bumped me bought a Flexible ticket because there were no Restricted Tickets left. So the highest bidder gets the seat. I had my Travel agent inquire as to whether I would be bumped again on the return and she got no reply. I was not bumped as the person who got my seat returned on a private jet as he met a friend on his travels. He had purchased long after me and had no seat assignments. Kangerlussuaq airport is small, overcrowded and chaotic. You get to go downstairs to get your bags and drag them back upstairs."
Air Greenland,"Flew Copenhagen to Maniitsoq via Kangerlussuaq. Air Greenland appears to be an airline of two parts: long range A330 to Denmark and Dash 8s on internal flights plus helicopters. A hot meal was served on the long flights with soft drinks, beer and wine and the outward flight was comfortable enough. The Dash 8 was awaiting our arrival for its 40 minute flight. On the return Maniitsoq airport only opened at noon due to weather problems [not uncommon] and they tried to combine two flights, but we were over-weight, so 8 passengers had to be left behind, for 2 days for the next flight. We were lucky and flew but were about 2 hours arriving for the Copenhagen flight. However it was running late already, they held it for a further 20 minutes so we could make the connection. So a satisfactory experience, and one appreciated the hostile environment for flying."
Air Greenland,Me and my wife flew up from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and back again. The food was perfect. The seats where okay but you couldn't lower it to a bed. There was no AVOD system but the pre selected movies were great directly from the cinema.
Air Iceland Connect,"Not Verified|  Icelandair has got to be the worst airline ever! First their kiosks weren’t working and I took for ever to check our bags because they wouldn’t print our boarding passes. Then on plane there was a may functioning light and we had to deboard, waited for over an hour for them to tell us the flight is canceled. They neglected to tell us where to get our bags and their customer Services were totally useless. They gave us a 200 dollar voucher they didn’t cover our families room making us waste money. We just came back to fly another flight and they just pushed it back another hour. There is no one manning Icelandair in the airport and is a disgrace of an airline."
Air Iceland Connect,"Not Verified|  Reykjavik to Akureyri. I have never been on a friendlier serviced aircraft than this! Absolutely wonderful flight, only 35 minutes, and quite a unique experience on a propeller plane. Absolutely love the onboard ""travel journal"" where you can read other passengers adventures and write your own in, very sweet! Would love to fly with them again next time I'm in Iceland!"
Air Iceland Connect,✅Trip Verified|  Egilsstadir to Reykjavík. Check in was a breeze. Waiting area very clean. Boarding was very easy just showing ticket and photo ID. It was a 45 minute flight. They served tea or coffee with a chocolate. I really enjoyed the flight as I did not want to travel by road again. I will fly them again.
Air India,"✅Trip Verified|   I was travelling from Sydney to Ahmedabad via Delhi. We were told to collect our baggage from Delhi and check in again at domestic airport. We were carrying alcohol that we bought from Sydney airport. At the time of check in at Delhi airport staff told us that we can carry alcohols with us as carry on. They told us to remove bottles from check in baggage. But at the time of boarding they came to us with weighing machine and charged us extra for over weight. My parents were really exhausted from 12 hrs flight and then we had to face this trouble. It was a nightmare for us. They charged us extra Rs 10,275. And after that they changed our seats. They made all three of us seated separately even though we had selected seats in advance. It was really terrible experience. I need to think twice in future before booking flight with air India."
Air India,"Not Verified| After the takeover of Air India, I made a commitment to fly only with Air India as a show of support for Tata, an organization that has contributed so much to my country. I was aware that the airline faced challenges, but I chose them nonetheless. On a recent flight, however, I was unexpectedly downgraded from business class to economy because my selected seat, along with two others, had been non-operational for several days. Shockingly, the airline still allowed me to select this faulty seat, and there was no mention of the issue during check-in. The flight experience was extremely disappointing. The seats had clearly been out of service for some time, yet no efforts were made to address the issue. With only a one-hour turnaround time, it seemed clear that maintenance was neglected. Being downgraded with no alternative options provided—such as rerouting through Mumbai or Delhi—felt completely unacceptable. The service, both on the ground and in the air, was unprofessional and disappointing, reminiscent of the old government-run days. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied."
Air India,✅Trip Verified|   We flew Air India from New Delhi to Kathmandu Nepal. We chose the 7 AM departure to make the most of our time in Nepal. We had to stay overnight at the airport hotel in T2 to make the very early flight. Check in was before 5 AM and it was smooth but security measures were strict. The flight was full and it is worthwhile to pay the USD12 for advance seat selection. We left a few minutes early and it was smooth 2 hours journey. Breakfast was included in economy. It was nothing special but appreciated by us as we had no time to eat before departure. Flight crew was efficient. Seat and aircraft were clean. We booked early and scored a low fare. But fare was not refundable. Indigo is an alternative low cost competitor with somewhat lower prices. But we are star alliance members of which air India is a partner. For a short flight would use Air India again. But we chose air Canada to get us from Toronto to New Delhi.
Air India,"✅Trip Verified|   I was appalled by the knowledge and customer service provided by Air India personnel in Chennai and Delhi. They lack proper training and are surprisingly unaware of their own processes. As a pet cat owner, I was relieved that Air India is one of the few airlines that allows pets in the cabin. However, my experience was far from satisfactory. I travelled from Chennai to Guwahati on AI 430 (Chennai to Delhi) and AI 891 (Delhi to Guwahati). It was a connecting flight, as Air India does not offer a direct service from Chennai to Guwahati. At the check-in counter, the attendant assisting me had no idea about the process of travelling with a pet on a connecting flight. She initially gave me a boarding pass for my luggage only to Delhi and instructed me to check in again in Delhi for the onward journey. When I asked if this was due to my pet, she insisted it was the standard procedure. After some back and forth, she called her supervisor, who clarified that I should check in my luggage for my final destination. This argument took 20 minutes and was a complete waste of time. Regarding my pet, they again refused to allow me to check her in for the entire journey, claiming it was a connecting flight. But that was the logic, that in a connecting flight, you are checked in till the final destination. After another 30 minutes of discussion, they finally agreed to check her in only to Delhi. During this process, they charged me a tax for pet travel, even though I had previously travelled with Air India without being charged. I was not provided a receipt because their printer was malfunctioning, and the entire check-in process took over an hour, leaving me with insufficient time to complete security checks and board. Once I arrived in Delhi, the attendant at the transfer counter was surprised that my pet hadn't been checked through to Guwahati. This meant I had to go through security again, removing my cat and hand luggage multiple times until I reached the check-in counter. There, I was informed that I was second in line for pets, as only two pets are allowed per flight. I was fine with this, but after 30 minutes, I was called back to the counter and informed that I could not travel because I was third in line. The staff member told me and then left as her shift ended, forcing me to start the explaining and arguing process all over again with new staff. After another 45 minutes of discussion, I explained that I had a connecting flight. If they denied me boarding, Air India would need to provide hotel accommodation and a new ticket. Fortunately, a senior staff member intervened, recognized the issue, and permitted me to board while denying passage to the other passenger from Delhi. This senior staff member explained that the confusion stemmed from the need for pet approval at the initial boarding location, something the Chennai staff seemed completely unaware of. I had to pay for my pet's travel a second time, but thankfully, they did not charge tax this time, contradicting what the Chennai staff had said. The entire experience was filled with arguments and wasted time and money, transforming what should have been an enjoyable trip into a headache."
Air India,"Not Verified| I recently flew with Air India on September 24, 2024, from Leh to Amritsar with a layover in Delhi, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve had with an airline. Our flight from Leh was delayed by an hour, and upon arrival in Delhi, we were informed without any prior notice that our connecting flight to Amritsar had been rescheduled to 9:00 PM. This change was made without our consent, and when I called customer service, I was told there were no other flights available. The staff at the Delhi airport were unhelpful and unresponsive. I was shocked that ground staff in Leh could not reach their colleagues in Delhi for assistance. The manager at the Delhi airport showed little interest in addressing our concerns, and the general attitude from staff was dismissive. To make matters worse, we observed that the 2:00 PM flight to Amritsar was still at the gate when we arrived. If we had been directed to that flight, we could have made it without issue. The food provided during our wait was inadequate, and we were not offered lounge access or even water. My frequent flyer points could not be added to my booking despite purchasing expensive tickets, and I was left feeling misled and frustrated. I wasted 12 hours with Air India, and I will think twice before flying with them again. Overall, I was very disappointed with the lack of support and communication from the staff. I hope my experience serves as a caution to others."
Air India,"✅Trip Verified|   I booked my Parents ticket first time with Air India as it is a Direct Flight from DEL to YYZ on 22nd Oct 2024. My Father is a heart patient and i requested a wheel chair for him throughout his journey. The staff at the airport was very rude to him and did not assisted him with lifting his bag to check the weight even he told that he his a heart patient is diabetic. The infotainment system was not working, the seat and tray were broken, the phone charging port was missing.  Not only this, the flight did not take off from Delhi 1hour after its departure time and there was not announcement done for the reason of its delay.  When he landed to Toronto, He was denied to get the wheelchair, He had to walk half of the airport before someone assisted him with the wheel chair and then abandoned him at the luggage area."
Air India,✅Trip Verified|   I booked a direct route with Air India for December. Yesterday I received notification that the flight is cancelled and a new late night flight on a convoluted route has been allotted to me. They ask me to contact them if I wish to find an alternative route. All bar one of the many phone numbers they list have a recorded message saying “this number does not exist”. The one number that does work has a recorded message saying “this person has not answered. Please call again later”. But — That person never picks up whatever time I call. The AI chat service they offer provides no assistance. The take away - everything they say about Air India notwithstanding the new branding and new ownership is true: book a flight with them at your peril. You might never leave the ground.
Air India,"✅Trip Verified|   I’ve flown Air India from Washington DC to New Delhi more than 10 times over the past few years, and overall my experience has been positive, with a few expected caveats. The non-stop flight, which takes around 14 hours, is a game-changer. Other airlines like Emirates or Etihad may save about 45 minutes in flight time, but the layovers add at least five extra hours to the journey. In my opinion, the extra time isn’t worth it. In economy, the seats are comfortable with decent legroom, so no complaints there. The check-in process has been smooth both in DC and New Delhi, and the cabin crew is generally polite and professional, which makes a difference on such long flights. I’ve chosen to stick with Air India even when it’s more expensive than other carriers because the convenience of flying direct outweighs the higher cost. That said, there are a few areas where improvement is needed. The aircraft on this route is showing its age, and the in-flight electronics are often broken. However, this isn’t a major issue for me since I bring my iPad and AirPods for entertainment. The food is decent, though a bit spicy at times. One thing that stands out is the strange timing of meal service on the return flight from Delhi to DC. Breakfast is served around 9 PM DC time, and dinner with drinks follows at about 2 or 3 AM, even though the flight lands at 7 AM. This timing makes it hard to get meals or sleep in sync with the destination. Despite these quirks, I’m happy with Air India overall. The convenience and comfort of flying direct make up for the minor issues, and I plan to continue using them until the new aircraft arrive and hopefully, things will only get better from there."
Air India,"✅Trip Verified|   Air India staff at Pune does not have complete info about luggage handling, they misguide us. We booked interconnected flights despite this they didn't tag our luggage till final destination. Now my luggage is in Singapore and 2 days passed no info received about my luggage. It's very disappointing. I was travelling with 2 kids (1 infant and 1 child)."
Air India,"✅Trip Verified| It seems that on the early morning departure from BOM to CCU, they have upgraded their aircraft from the A320 to the A321 which resulted in additional seating and so I was able to get a seat onboard this flight. Departure was on time and for breakfast had opted for the omelet with hash browns which was good. The crew were quite nice during this flight and landing into Calcutta was timely. For the price paid the flight was pretty good."
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified|   The flight was delayed for hours, and I missed my international connecting flight because of that. I tried calling customer care after that, and there's no response even after calling their helpline number that says 24x7 availability. Worst journey ever. I will never fly this airline again. Can't believe it exists."
Air India Express,Not Verified| There is a lite ticket which allows only cabin baggage and not checking baggage. That check-in baggage is not allowed in lite category ticket was not explicitly mentioned. This was a big hit for me as I discovered I had to pay 1500 for a 3 kg pack for check-in. What kind of a rule is this? Will never ever fly Air India express. It should be named Air India unreserved passenger and not express
Air India Express,✅Trip Verified|   It was my first time travelling on Air india express and it was great. When I got stuck at Emigration one staff came and helped me by giving his phone to call my family because my phone was dead. The inflight service was not that great. The Air hostess have too much attitude. Most of the time they were just chit chatting with each other not attending properly to the people in need.
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified|   Air India Express is my usual choice of travel by flight and I am happy with their service and flight timings.  Would like to make special mention of my check in today which was very smooth and efficient. The staff at the counter checked us in with a very professional and efficient manner, and a friendly approach. The process did not take very long and before we knew it we were on our way . It is because of such service that Air India Express stands out from the rest of the airlines and I prefer Air India Express whenever the need for travel by air arises."
Air India Express,"Not Verified|   I had a frustrating experience with Air India Express during my recent flight. Despite having 8 kg less than the allowed weight for my checked baggage, they wouldn’t let me take an extra 1 kg in my cabin baggage. When I arrived at the airport, I made sure to comply with all the baggage policies. However, at the check-in counter, the staff insisted that I adhere strictly to the cabin baggage limit, even though my checked baggage was well under the weight limit. I tried explaining that I wasn’t exceeding the overall allowance, but they were inflexible and didn’t seem to care about the context. In the end, I had to leave some of my belongings behind, which was incredibly inconvenient and stressful. It felt unfair and inconsistent with their overall baggage policy. It was a disappointing experience that left me questioning whether I’d choose Air India Express again in the future."
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified|   I have hand / cabin luggage of 8kg and my laptop. when the ground staff verify the weight the combined weight is came around 12kg. the ground staff advised me, that i will be allowed to fly max with 10kg including my laptop. i advised i never had an experience in any of my air travel that the laptop is being weighted. i had removed some stuff from baggage and bring it to 7kg and after adding my laptop its became 11kg. the ground still not allowing me to drop the baggage and advising me to reduce 1 more kg. finally i end up in leaving my hand trolly bag in airport and took all my stuff in the reusable bag."
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified|   I recently flew with Air India Express, and I have to say, it was an absolutely horrible experience. My luggage check-in time was 4:50 AM, and due to unexpected traffic caused by construction, I arrived at 5:01 AM. Instead of offering any help, the agent at the counter simply denied me boarding and acted like I was an inconvenience. I usually leave my home two hours early to avoid any issues, but this day was different, and I was not the only passenger affected. Rather than showing any empathy, she spent her time on her phone, completely ignoring us. After begging for about 15-20 minutes, she finally called her supervisor, only to demand an extra 4,000 rupees to board with my luggage, claiming I was late. Meanwhile, another passenger with no luggage was also charged 4,000 because he hadn’t done web check-in. It was absurd. On the return leg, I faced another issue with a connecting flight. My flight was late, and all I got was a 5 rupee water bottle for my trouble. I arrived in Bangalore at 12:45 PM, with a connecting flight at 1 PM. Somehow, the flight was fine waiting for some passengers but couldn’t show the same courtesy to me when I was late. It’s not just about the money; it’s about the complete lack of professionalism and respect from the staff. If you want to charge extra for being late, just ask. But ignoring passengers while you’re glued to your phone? I am extremely disappointed and will never fly with you again."
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified|   It was awful to travel with this flight. They surprised me in the check in area, after one and half hours standing in the line I got to the counter for boarding pass but they were telling me that there was a payment, payment for what reason? They said seat selection, i was go through the web check in but i dont confirm or select any seat. I explain to them but they insisted to pay. At last i pay 55 SAR instead of 25 SAR, 30 SAR tax they said). Totally disappointed travel."
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified| Review for Ms. Sandra, Air India Express Counter Staff – Madurai Airport I had the pleasure of interacting with Ms. Sandra at the Air India Express counter during my departure from Madurai to Singapore on 30th September 2024. Her professionalism and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression on me. She was incredibly helpful, honest, and approachable, all while maintaining a warm smile throughout the process. Her prompt assistance made the entire check-in process smooth and stress-free, and it was evident that she genuinely cared about providing excellent service to passengers. Ms. Sandra’s positive attitude and dedication truly enhanced my travel experience. I am grateful for her efforts and would like to commend her for her outstanding service. Thank you, Ms. Sandra, for making my departure from Madurai a pleasant one. I look forward to experiencing such exceptional service again in the future. I appreciate TaTa’ Air India Express for recruiting and employing such exceptional people."
Air India Express,"✅Trip Verified|   The worst possible experience. I reserved this flight, and I arrived an hour before takeoff. However, a few self-drop baggage machines were not working due to hurriedness, wasting valuable time. As a result, at approximately 10:20, they stopped accepting our bags and told us that the allotted time had passed. The staff members were also extremely unprofessional and unresponsive, not prepared to assist. They moreover they asked us to cancel the ticket and this is not happened with us only other passengers also faced the same issue. Not at acceptable our money and time is wasted"
Air Italy,"✅Trip Verified|  Milan to Male. Nice airline. Very good in all services. Economy class is a very good class. Beverages are very good too with a lot of product. On my flight services were 3: snack, lunch and a afternoon snack with a slice of pizza. If you need something else you can ask to steward that will help you in every moment. Staff is very kind and happy. Good airline."
Air Italy,"Not Verified|  Munich to Bologna and Pisa to Munich, both on an Embraer 195, economy. Both flights handled efficiently, southbound on time, northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight (there had been thick fog at MUC early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning). However, support given to those with tight connections. Modest in-flight service - snacks and drinks - wine came in proper glasses. Air Dolomiti worked okay for us."
Air Italy,"✅Trip Verified|  My flight Catania to Milan was 2 hrs late and when we arrived no one from Air Italy was at gate to help us to catch our flights to Miami which we missed. No one at transfer desk. Doors locked to floor for check in desk. Security would not help. We were told flights would wait but air Italy did not. It took many hours, even business class, to secure cheap hotel room far from airport. They would not even give me seat or ticket for flight next day. When we got To this hotel, their restaurant already closed. I finally gọt seat the next day with no apologies. WiFi not free for business class."
Air Italy,"Not Verified|  Verona to Mahon. Flight at full hour, aircraft slightly dated but maintained better than others, very comfortable seats. In mid flight we were served a very good snack. nice and elegant and above all professional hostesses. volo in pieno orario,aereo leggermente datato ma tenuto meglio di altri, sedili molto comodi. a metà volo ci è stato servito lo spuntino, molto buono. hostess carine e eleganti e soprattutto professionali."
Air Italy,"✅Trip Verified|  New York to Catania via Milan. We flew business class on the way over on this trip. Service was okay. Food was not great. Upon arrival, despite having 'priority' tags on our bags my bag never showed up in Sicily. There was no way to contact anyone at Air Italy and they only have 1 person who manages lost and found bags. No compensation or return upgrade was offered. I had to spend every day trying to track my bag and spend money to replace things. A complete waste of precious vacation time. We arrived on Saturday afternoon and I didn't get my bag until Thursday afternoon (we left Italy a few days later). When I inspected my bag I realized they cut through 2 sections of the bag even though there was a TSA lock and I gave them the code. They also went through my belongings for no reason (my original tag with name and information was still attached). Everything was just shoved back in haphazardly. It was also impossible to get a hold of anyone on the phone (used the US toll free number), you wait on hold and then the system hangs up on you. They really had a negative impact on my vacation and cost me a lot of money."
Air Italy,"✅Trip Verified| Although my original flight from New York to Palermo was on time I was not impressed with the staff nor the plane itself. The staff were rude and not friendly at all, instead it seemed we were more of a nuisance rather than paying customers. On our flight home we were delayed over 3 hours and we were never informed prior to arrival at the airport. This delay led us to miss our connecting flight to New York. Although issues may arise with the planes the way they handled the situation was unprofessional. Once we arrived in Milan they gave us little direction on where we needed to go in the airport and we wasted an hour trying to figure out what we needed to do next. The airline put us up in a hotel and said we would leave the next day at the same time. At the hotel they provided us “dinner” which included dry pasta, processed chicken, mush for green beans and potatoes. When we asked for more sauce for the dry pasta they refused to give it to us unless we paid for it."
Air Italy,"✅Trip Verified|  We arrived at SFO Air Italy desk to see staff was just standing around and talking, it was as we where inconveniencing them. I was trying to ask questions but they would over talk me and not take the time to listen to my questions. I just gave up on asking about our seats. Worst customer service ever. On our flight, the attendants stood in the back galley talking. This is not an airline I will be flying in the future."
Air Italy,"Not Verified|  Flew Business Class from Milan to New York. Worst Business Class I have ever experienced. We were made to stand for one hour before boarding and the gate agents were never advised by the Captain that the flight would be delayed as the plane had to be cleaned! The board stated that we were leaving on time though this was clearly not the case. All they had to do is post a new departure time instead of leaving the original departure time on the board. I suspected something fishy in Cagliari when I noticed that 2 of their flights to Milan were over one hour delayed. Fortunately we flew Alitalia on this route. The food was awful except for the pasta dish which was served lukewarm. The seats were not completely flat but this did not bother me. The Purser insisted that everyone on the plane put their shades down though this was a day flight. The whole economy section was in the dark! He kept on putting my shades down without my permission. When I told him no the 3rd time as I was reading he told me to put the light on. I insisted on keeping half of one shade up. Their Dining on Demand like on Qatar and Etihad is a joke! They don't follow the time you request to eat and even forgot the desert. If they can't do it properly don't do it! The steward got angry with my travelling companion because she fell asleep between the hour we asked to wait for the entree after we had finished the appetizer. He had to reopen her tray table and the tablecloth had fallen to the floor. Seats are not fully flat but this did not bother me. The economy class legroom looked awful too. Clearly a 2nd rate unprofessional operation. Inflight entertainment was very limited and the music / audio pretty bad. OK they give pajamas but quite frankly I never wear them, especially on a day flight."
Air Italy,"Not Verified|  New York JFK to Rome via Milan. First: Ticketing Counter: Very inconvenient counter locations at the airport, the farthest counter from everything, around the corner and hidden behind all other counters that you actually have to ask someone to locate. By the way, they do not affiliate with Air Italy. First I thought it was just at JFK but to my surprise it was the same setup in Rome. Seems like they picked the cheapest counters at the airport. Second: Leg Room: Let's start with tight seats with no leg room, they do not meet the standard requirements. Once the seat in front of me is reclined, I literally was trapped and could not get up. I could not even close the food tray that was jammed on my lap. Wanted to reach out to flight attendant for help but obviously couldn’t reach out the overhead help button. No one walked by for hours until dinner time, but even then she was not able to help. As if people in economy do not matter at all. I understand that they have to treat upper class customers better but they cannot ignore economy class to that level. Third: Baggage Fee: No charge for luggage from US to Rome but they hit you with 'No luggage allowed' policy for economy unless you pay 100 euro each. As if it’s not the same bag came on the flight in to Rome. Why charge only one leg of the flight? When I refused the pay, they referred me to the supervisor who finally showed up after half an hour but was not helpful at all. In fact she was extremely rude and pretty much said to us “this the way it is whether you like or not”."
Air Italy,"Not Verified|  My flight was to Milan from Toronto and return. Check-in was fast, the crew were polite and efficient on the ground and in flight. For the most part both of my flights were on time, just on the way back there was a delay of 2 hours but Expedia had informed me through e-mail 2 days prior of my flight. I was pleasantly surprised regarding the meals served on board to and from Italy, not only you can choose from a menu but the food was delicious! Also I found that choosing the option to pay for checked baggage on Air Italy site was much cheaper than paying at the airport, I paid in Canadian dollars instead of euros. I usually fly with Air Canada but Air Italy was much cheaper in comparison. The only thing that I would appreciate is that when choosing the option to pay for my checked bag online that it would indicate ""1 checked baggage included"" at time of booking. The flight was smooth and very pleasant. I will definitely fly with Air Italy again in the near future."
Air Juan,"Not Verified|  I booked a flight with Air Juan in March 2019 with departure date on the 2nd August 2019. The airline then informed me about the flight cancellation on the 31st July 2019. They offered me options of rebook, refund or travel credits. I chose to have a refund and got the form to fill in. I sent the filled from back on the 1st of August 2019. Then it took 27 days from the airline to reply and they then promised the refund within 65-70 business days. Now I have contacted the airline once again on the 28th January 2020 and they replied that my refund is still in queue."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  Do not book with this airline. It is a complete scam. Flights are regularly cancelled hours before the scheduled take-off for ""maintenance"" and then a refund is never given. My wife and I were left scrambling to arrange alternative flights and we have not received any refund after 9 months of waiting. If you look online you will find hundreds of similar reviews."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified| I was in Manila and had only 2 days to go for diving. I've chosen (close by) Puerto Galera and since my time was limited I booked a flight with Air Juan. They cancelled my flight approx. 10 days before my trip and sent me a request for reimbursement to fill in. I sent back the request on 18 April! Recently they stopped replying to my follow up e-mails. I booked a flight with another Manila-based company, they also cancelled but sent me back money in a couple of weeks. It is worth mentioning that I also lost the payment of 1 night in a very nice hotel there since I was unable to travel by car/bus and ferry (limited time)."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  
Busuanga to Caticlan. No refund after flight cancellation The flight was canceled allegedly due to aircraft maintenance. It was pre-paid by credit card and Air Juan offered me a refund. I sent them the refund form but I never received the 7,900 PHP back."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  In March we booked our flights with Air Juan for the month of May with 400 Euro and paid the same. Two days before the first flight came an Email with cancellation due to problems and the safety of the passengers go. A few days later came the cancellation that the return flight was also canceled. At the request to refund the money we only got standard emails. This tactic is annoying and so we threatened with a complaint to the aviation authority and appointed a lawyer. Then we switched on our bank immediately after arrival in Germany. Over a complaint with the credit card we got now after 3 months our money back again. We never received a message again with an apology from AirJuan. Thousands of tourists are cheated out of their money by Air Juan's tactics. Many tourists either do not answer at all or do not know how to get their money back. During our holiday in El Nido, Bohol and Cebu we met 8 tourists who also got a cancellation one day before the flight. So stay away from this airline. Then better with Philippine Airlines"", AirSwift or Cebu Pacific."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  Caticlan to Busuanga. Our flight booked months before (october 2018) was canceled one week before departure due to ""aircraft maintenance inspection"". They sent us a document for the refund request, stating that the amount would be refunded within 35-40 working days. The canceled flight was scheduled for the 16th february 2019, today is the 24th june 2019 and nothing has been refunded yet! I keep sending them emails every week, and every email I send, they always reply in the same vague and useless way, stating that ""they will contact the involved office and will send a copy of the transaction once available"", which never arrives! I will be forced to send people directly to their office in Manila in order to be able to get my 13,000 PHP back, just for the canceled flight!! Where I live, since it is the airline's fault, they should have even provided an alternative way to get to destination and provided the extra night in the hotel we had to spend!! These people really don't know how to treat their customers."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  Manila to Puerto Galera. Air Juan gave me by far the worst experiences of airlines ever. On my first flight 2017, they managed to forget my luggage -on a 3 passenger flight! In January 2019 I booked 2 tickets for a return flight to PG. On March 11 it was rescheduled, on March 29 it was cancelled. To this very day I have not received the refund of PhP 20k. I keep writing, Air Juan keeps dodging. Broke? Lazy?Incompetent?  I warn everybody of booking or flying with such an unreliable operation!"
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  Manila to Puerto Galera. They cancelled the flights 4 days prior to departure, and despite my several requests, I have never been refunded. Do not fly with this company."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  This airline cancels flights on people if they can sell the seat for more money. They cancelled both my flights because I had purchased the tickets as a ""Super Saver"" price. I have followed their procedures and policy's but they have stopped replying to my emails for a refund, 122 business day later. The last email was ""It's with the accounting department and they will process the return shortly""."
Air Juan,"✅Trip Verified|  Booked a flight from Manila to Puerto Galera in October 2018. Informed days before that that flight had been cancelled due to routine maintenance. If routine then why the unexpected unavailability of the aircraft? Was given the choice of a refund or credit towards another flight, so opted for credit (silly me). Re-booked for a Puerto Galera to Manila flight in March 2019 (and had to pay an extra 1,000 pesos for the privilege). Days before that flight it was also cancelled for - you guessed it - routine maintenance. This time I opted for a refund and after filling out and returning the form was told it would take 25 to 30 working days to process. 40 days later, I'm still waiting for my refund. After numerous emails, the response to which was always a copperplate 'your refund is still in process' I contacted my bank for a charge-back, only to be informed that the 90 day expiry had passed already. So tough luck. Total scam."
Air KBZ,"✅Trip Verified|  
Yangon to Nyaung. My wife and me flew three routes with Air KBZ over our holiday in Myanmar and we got outstanding service every time. The cabin crew all have excellent presentation and are very courteous and attentive. We had a cold snack, tea and coffee, all of which were very tasty, on all flights. Its unusual to be given cream cakes at 8.30 am, but they were very nice. All aircraft used were very clean and in good condition and all flights departed and arrived exactly on time. Air KBZ is way better than we expected."
Air KBZ,Not Verified|  I took the flight K7-708 from Mandalay to Heho to get to Inle Lake as it is the quickest way to get there. This was my first time flying with Air KBZ and it was a pleasant flight. Check-in and boarding was very efficient. The flight left Mandalay about 10 minutes before the scheduled time and arrived about 15 minutes earlier. The cabin was very clean and seats were comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly. I will not hesitate to fly again with Air KBZ.
Air KBZ,"✅Verified Review|  Yangon to Mandalay. Really good flight, the seating was 2-2 and actual seat numbers given on boarding pass, plenty of space even at 6'4"" inflight catering offered, light snack and good coffee. Nothing to worry about despite ATR aircraft type and would definitely fly again."
Air KBZ,"✅Verified Review|  Heho to Yangon. Another very good flight same ATR aircraft, no seat numbers given but all very easy boarding. Plenty of space, 2-2 seating and inflight snacks given with coffee or Tea. One member of crew not happy but not the end of the world. At 6'4"" I had no problem with the seat space in fact better than many European airlines."
Air KBZ,"✅Verified Review| Flew RGN-SNW, arrived at the Yangon Domestic Terminal an hour and a half ahead of the flight. Check-in was smooth, received my passenger identification sticker and waited in the restaurant. Boarding was via a bus from the gate to the aircraft. The plane was an ATR-72 and seating was done quickly. Flight was full. Aircraft left on time and boxed refreshments and tea/coffee were served soon after the seatbelt signs went off after take-off by well-presented aircrew. Flight arrived on time and on disembarking, after clearing immigration, received my bag within half an hour and was out of the airport. Return flight SNW-RGN was slightly less orderly with three Air KBZ flights leaving within 45 minutes of each other. Seating area was full in the lower floor of the departure terminal so went up to the top floor and sat out on the deck to watch the planes landing from the seaward direction. Once on board the ATR-72, flight was smooth, again received a box with sweet buns and boxed juice in, and tea/coffee served. Flight arrived on time again and bags were slightly delayed at Yangon. I was impressed with the service throughout and would fly again."
Air KBZ,"✅Verified Review| I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Air KBZ flying from Yangon to Mandalay. I bought the ticket just two days before the flight and the fare was very reasonable. Check-in was fast and efficient, and a Air KBZ employee approached me in the line and escorted me to the check-in desk and helped me check-in. The domestic terminal is small and a bit chaotic, but this is not Air KBZ's fault and should be remedied when the new domestic terminal is finished. There are no screens announcing that boarding has commenced, so you have to pay attention to the airline employees who walk up and down the waiting area with hand-held signs with your airline and flight number on it. Boarding was via a bus to the aircraft. The plane was clean, in good condition and the seats were comfortable. The flight crew was helpful and friendly. We were served a light breakfast on this 80 minute flight. The flight took off and landed on time. I would certainly fly Air KBZ again."
Air KBZ,"Yangon to Thandwe and pleasantly surprised by Air KBZ. Snacks served onboard – seats generally comfortable. Organisational issues with boarding and a slight delay in departure from Yangon. Check in at RGN was not very organised, however, once inside the departure terminal - ground staff were more helpful. They give you a coloured sticker to put on your shirt to ensure you get on the correct flight. Would use again."
Air KBZ,"We recently took 4 internal flights on AirKBZ during our holiday in Myanmar. They use mainly ATR72 500-600 aircraft for these flights. They serve a snack and a drink on flights longer than 1 hour, on shorter flights boiled sweets are served. The planes were newish and in reasonable condition. At every check in you are given a sticker to identify your destination, once onboard these stickers are seen on the backs of every seat and safety cards. FAs were professional and pleasant. The schedules were punctual, as the turnaround time on hopping flights is well under 20 minutes, some of the flights left before time as soon as all the passengers were on board!"
Air KBZ,"I had not heard of Air KBZ before I made the booking for my Myanmar trip. However, all of the three domestic flights (Mandalay to Thandwe, Thandwe to Sittwe and Sittwe to Yangon) went very well: on-time arrivals, food and beverages free of charge although the flights were short, friendly staff, modern and clean aircraft. I would fly Air KBZ again in case I return to Myanmar."
Air Koryo,"✅Trip Verified|  Pyongyang to Vladivostok. Clean classic aircraft with amazing engine sound. Seats were a bit narrow, but okay for a flight of around one hour and ten minutes. Cabin staff was friendly, sandwich and lemonades, water were provided free. Excellent experience."
Air Koryo,"✅Trip Verified| Beijing to Pyongyang. Comparing an intra-European flight of 2 hours and this flight, practically no differences: clean aircraft, nice stewardesses, punctual, simple food, good and attentive service, a normal standard."
Air Koryo,"✅Verified Review|  Aircraft clean with immaculately presented and polite cabin attendants. Seat comfortable with great leg room. Flights on time. Inflight entertainment consisted of North Korean military type music. Food was a cold burger with a choice of water, coffee, tea or soft drink."
Air Koryo,✅Verified Review| Everything went smooth from Pyongyang to Beijing. Check-in staff were friendly. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment could have been better. Food and drinks decent enough.
Air Koryo,✅Verified Review|  Pyongyang to Beijing with hot/cold drinks and a hamburger which was adequate for length of flight. Very polite and welcoming service. Efficient check in and boarding. In flight entertainment limited to a video of recent North Korean hits. Pyongyang Times and Korea Today  available to take on board.
Air Koryo,"✅Verified Review| Pyongyang to Beijing with Air Koryo. The departure and arrival were punctual, staff smiling and friendly, the aircraft, including toilets, was clean and there were magazines and newspapers at the entrance. The food was a chicken burger but the drink selection was rather limited, either water or one type of soft drink. It is maybe not the most luxurious airline but the service for a short-haul flight is better than European or American airlines I have used for the same distance."
Air Koryo,"✅Verified Review|  Beijing to Pyongyang. The aircraft was clean, cabin crew friendly and the flight on time. You get the Pyongyang Times to read aboard. I flew for the first time this type of a Tupolev and found not much difference to some other aircraft. The food was acceptable. The selections of beverages could be better."
Air Koryo,"✅Verified Review|  It is absolutely unfair to give only one star to this airline: the Tupolev plane is in good condition and perfectly clean, the crew are efficient, pleasant and helpful, and last but not least, it is always on time, you can find many airlines much worse than that, for instance Air China on the same route. The route flown is the no. 1 route of Air Koryo linking DPRK to Beijing, and this entitles you to some patriotic videos on the overhead screen. The buns served are not too bad, and drinks are acceptable for such a small trip. All in all, a good experience."
Air Koryo,"✅Verified Review|  I don't know how things were in the past, but there is no current reason for a one star review. Flew from Beijing to Pyongyang. From a comfort perspective, Air Koryo was just like any international economy class seat. Yes, the inflight entertainment for the 2 hour flight was basically North Korean propaganda and magazines from North Korea - but surely if you are a tourist to North Korea that is exactly what you are interested in. In fact, you'd probably prefer that to say Big Bang Theory episode re-runs. The food was average. The service was perfectly passable."
Air Koryo,"Beijing to Pyongyang. The Tupolev 204-100 aircraft is as comfortable as many that are flying around the US. The check-in experience was quick at Beijing and Pyongyang. The crew were friendly and smiling during the flight. The ""burger"" was quite tasty and I got a beer with it. Baggage quickly delivered at both ends."
Air Labrador,Rigolet Labrador to Goose Bay Labrador on 13 October 2013 on an Air Labrador twin Otter. Aircraft has been well used over the years but provided a comfortable and quick way back to Goose Bay. Bush flying co-pilot loaded and unloaded the bags seating - well- wherever there is an empty seat. No complaints about the service and would not hesitate to fly with them again.
Air Macau,"Not Verified| In February, I flew from Narita, Tokyo to Macau. I bought premium economy class. The website stated that the flight meals were business class and served on economy class plates. In the end, they only provided the same meals as economy class, and I felt unsafe in the cabin. I will not fly Air Macau again."
Air Macau,"✅Trip Verified| I had a great experience flying with Air Macau yesterday. Was surprised that other reviewers have rated them so low. In particular, their reservations team were really helpful when we had problems with our travel agent, travelgenio. Our original flight was cancelled by Air Macau 2 weeks before departure, which was annoying but they offered us a selection of four alterative flights (via our travel agent). Our travel agent then gave us the wrong rebooked flight details. We therefore didn't turn up to the airport for the flight and we looked like a no show to Air Macau. Travel agent took no responsibility for their error and we were worried we would have to pay for a new ticket. However, a quick call to Air Macau customer services and they rebooked us onto a flight the following day for no extra charge. Brilliant! Departure experience: There was a bit of a queue at check in but not abnormally long. 1.5hr flight included a pork roll, cookie and water which was a nice touch. All the staff were friendly too. I suppose one downside was that there was no inflight entertainment and electrical sockets, but that didn't bother us on such a short flight. I would definitely fly with them again."
Air Macau,"✅Trip Verified|  Hangzhou to Macau. I have had the misfortune of flying Air Macau numerous times over the past 6 years. On virtually every occasion the flight has been late, often by at least 2 hours. The airline has the annoying habit of boarding passengers first, and only then informing them of the delay, creating a long and frustrating wait on the tarmac. The Macau - Beijing route seems particularly liable to delay, but recently I have travelled on Air Macau to Hangzhou and Nanjing and both flights were 2 hours+ late, with little or no explanation. Air Macau gives the impression that it simply does not care. After many years of international travel, Air Macau is quite simply the most unreliable airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly on."
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  Beijing to Macau. Air Macau is the only one carrier operating 3 daily flights from Beijing to Macau. The aircraft they use on this route is A321. The flight attendants can speak English well, but the service do not have any shining spot. Dinner is provided on this flight, which tastes not too bad. Although the plane delayed for 30min to get airborne, due to traffic of Beijing Airport, the flight made landing 10min earlier than estimated, which surprised me."
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  Bangkok to Macau with Air Macau. Check-in in BKK was painful. The line was long and extremely slow moving. Check-in staff in BKK seemed busier chatting / messaging on their cellphones. The agent who was checking us in was unpleasant and unprofessional. She was busier message chatting on her phone when we reached the check-in counter. She didn't know the dimension of cabin baggage yet tried to deny my IATA cabin certified carry-on. Then, she started ""lecturing"" my 67 years old mother and I on Macau immigration requirements, imply us as potential over-stayers. I am an economist at an international organization and I travel on a monthly basis for work and leisure; I used to work in the air transport sector myself and I have lived in 6 different countries and I am very well informed with immigration requirements.  Finally, we only receive our boarding passes after the involvement of check-in supervisor. On the other hand, kudos to check-in personnel at MFM. Check-in was a breeze - the line was fast moving, and personnel were friendly, helpful and efficient. No personal IFE on board; seats for both ways were very uncomfortable; food was average but only water was offered. Flights were slightly delayed both directions. In-flight attendants were a mix bag, some were very enthusiastic and passionate while others provided minimal service."
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  No pre-flight selections of seats. All seats have to be assigned upon checkin at airport counter in Macau and in Bangkok. This procedure takes forever and so time consuming. Flight experience on the return trip, Bangkok/Macau was horrific. The flight was scheduled for 9:50 pm but was delayed for at least an hour. Was warned that this airline on-time performance is terrrible and it sure is. In addition, cabin temp was too hot making it impossible to breathe. Never again will I fly with this airline. A full fare airline that is performing worse than a budget airline. AirAsia far better."
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  I used Air Macau for a round-trip from Tokyo to Narita. I was able to get the tickets for a quite low price, so I was not expecting much from this airline. At the end, I was able to get a fair flight from them, but there were still some issues that made my journey inconvenient. The thing that bugged me was that some items in the cabin seemed to either have issues or was non-functional. One of them was the tray tables. It was mandatory for me to use it as both of my flights included 1 meal. But, whenever I try to place my food tray on it, it keeps sliding towards me. It was quite annoying at the time. Also, in one of my flights my seat recliner was broken. Despite the poor maintenance, the cabin staff was very friendly and helpful on both of my flights.  Overall, Air Macau is a minor airline and passengers shouldn't expect much from them. If you are a person that doesn't mind the poor condition of the plane and want a straight flight to Macau, then I would recommend this airline to you. If not, then I would rather suggest taking other flights heading to Hong Kong and using the ferry from Hong Kong to Macau."
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  Macau to Chengdu. My debut with this carrier, check-in at 1000 for noon flight, staff said flight will be delayed but didn't know exact departure time, and said will notify me once confirm. Wait until 1500, receive SMS that flight departs 1700. Finally I decided to cancel my trip. I like to say I book through their site, air fare is standard fare which is not value for money, for a national carrier their ground staff and services seems like budget airline. The staff are not initiated and not intended to compensate or apology. Regret to choose this carrier and highly not recommended!"
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  Hanoi to Macau with Air Macau, and not very impressed with cabin crew and safety procedures. I fly a lot and have used many different airlines. It appeared that the staff were not interested in doing their job properly. The passenger in front of me never put on his seat belt once, (take off and landing included) and not one member of staff checked or asked him to do so. The woman in the isle seat next to me had 3 bags which she held on her knee and at her feet, a flight attendant came to answer her question about how long the flight would take, but negated to request the passenger to put her luggage in the stow compartment during take off and landing. Some seats remained reclined during decent. I will mention (and this may reflect on the airport) but once we were off the aircraft we were put onto a bus to take us to the gate, as the door opened there was a lot of pushing and shoving from passengers to be the first one off and through to passport check. I had to hold onto a rail so that I would not be pushed over. I have never experienced anything like this.  This airline could much better if improvements are made in regard to the above."
Air Macau,"✅Verified Review|  Shanghai to Macau with Air Macau. My flight NX135 was supposed to depart at 16:40. I got to the airport at 15:00 and I was told that the flight was delayed because the airplane was still in Macau. So at least 3 hours delay but they had no idea when the plane was flying to Shanghai and also no idea why it was still in Macau. At the gate, the staff told us it was due to ""air traffic"" and ""weather in Guangzhou"". In the end, we boarder at 23:30. I spent 8.5 hours at the airport. When I came back, I was told by my friends and colleagues that this is very common with Air Macau, thus I am sure I'm not flying with this airline anymore."
Air Madagascar,"✅Trip Verified|  My wife and I booked round trip flights to Majahanga from Tana with Air Madagascar on January 21st. Last Saturday due to the continued stringent travel restrictions in place in South Africa and Madagascar and the uncertainty the idea of well any kind of travel really during a global pandemic we sadly were forced to cancel our honeymoon. We informed the airline of our decision in writing and four days later (i.e. yesterday) we received an email (from a Gmail account no less) offering a single penalty-free flight change valid 'til January 2021 despite our expressly requesting for a refund. Which airline in this day and age doesn't have their own email domain? Real professional outfit. We let it be known immediately in a subsequent email that we didn't appreciate not-so-subtly being coerced to accept a ""solution"" to a problem not of our making that benefits them at our expense. We are still awaiting a response. As others have pointed out flights with this airline are a lottery. I wish we'd known this beforehand so we could've saved ourselves the headache. We'd give them a zero rating if we could. They really are that bad."
Air Madagascar,"Not Verified|  Antananarivo to Johannesburg. This is the worst airline I have used. The two flights I booked with them were both canceled on the day of the flight. One was canceled due to mechanical problems on the plane, only after everyone had boarded, and was replaced by another flight 12 hours later. The other an international flight to Johannesburg was canceled with no explanation. We were told that the next flight wasn’t for a full week thereafter, which would have caused us to miss our international flight back to the US. The customer service agent could only offer me a call center email address for requesting a refund. When I did so, they told me they could only process the refund through “my travel agent” — but I had booked the tickets myself, on the Internet! Canceling a flight and not refunding it is called stealing."
Air Madagascar,"✅Trip Verified|  Booked an Air Madagascar return ticket from Nairobi to Antananarivo, operated by Kenya Airways both ways (cheaper than booking directly via Kenya Airways). Onward flight date comes and there's no check in counter for Air Madagascar at Nairobi Airport so I go to the Kenya Airways counter and attempt to check in. They have a hard time locating my name in the system but I assume they override it manually and check me in regardless since my ticket clearly indicates that I should be on the flight. Fast forward 2 days and I'm at the airport in Antananarivo for my flight back to Nairobi. Same story, no check in counter for Air Madagascar (in Madagascar!) and I go over to the Kenya Airways counter again and they can't locate my name in the system again. I go to the Air Madagascar ticketing office and they confirm that I'm on the flight. I go back to the check in counter and this back and forth happens 2 more times (going through security over and over again, everyone looking at me crazier each time) and each time, the people at the check in counter can't locate my name. Finally, the fella at the Air Madagascar ticketing office issues me a new ticket for later in the day free of charge. Nice gesture and in order for this not to happen again, I try to check in myself online.. guess what? Air Madagascar doesn't have an online check in feature on their website! I'm writing this as I wait for my second flight, wondering whether I'll have to go through this ordeal again later. I recommend just booking with Kenya Airways directly."
Air Madagascar,Not Verified|  Antananarivo to Majunga. Flight was operated by EWA; two hours late and information about the delay was bad; aircraft was a little bit old; friendly FA; some refreshments served. Fare a little bit high.
Air Madagascar,"Not Verified|  Tuléar to Antananarivo. Quick Check-in; on time; plane a bit old; refreshments and a snack served; friendly flight attendants. The fare was somehow high, but this is Madagascar. You shouldn't come here if you are pampered by low-cost carriers;"
Air Madagascar,"✅Trip Verified|  Antsiranana to Sambava. Flight was booked in Air Madagascar website; flight was operated by Air Tsaradia, the new domestic carrier. Check-in quite fast; not too serious about little overweight luggage and cabin luggage; due to the short flight-time, no refreshments, fare a little bit expensive compared to flight-time; alternative would have been to travel 12h on very bad road."
Air Madagascar,"✅Trip Verified| Flew Sainte Marie to Antananarivo with Air Madagascar. Online, this looks to be an airline of last resort, but I found myself requiring their services at the end of a holiday in Madagascar. I wasn't totally surprised when my flight was cancelled, and the replacement flight the next day ran 2 hours late. To their credit, they were very forthcoming with meals and accommodation while we were stranded."
Air Madagascar,"✅Verified Review|  Antananarivo to Fort Dauphin. I have flown multiple times on domestic flights with Air Madagascar over the past few years. They are truly the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying with. Delays, cancellations, bad customer service, dirty planes, no in-flight refreshments, hugely over-priced. In one instance I chose to travel for over 50 hours on a public bus to reach my destination, rather than give any more money to them and I would probably do that again after yet another delay on my most recent flight."
Air Madagascar,"✅Verified Review|  Paris to Antananarivo return. Never use this airline if you plan on getting home on time. Our homeflight was cancelled without notice. It took a full extra day to get home - we have filed a complaint and sought compensation, and after 7 consecutive emails, we recieved only one short response from air Madagascar we got no compensation at all."
Air Madagascar,"Antananarivo to Fort Dauphin via Morondava and no notable issues with Air Madagascar service. Easy website to navigate and book. All flights were on time with pleasant crew and ground service as well. Snacks on outward flights only, and return flight had a fruit danish and coffee only (100 minute flight). Nice, very nice and bright interior on the ATR 72 (first time I'd flown this aircraft). But - and this is a well known issue for Air Madagascar - they did move the departure time up for my return flight to Tana, From 940 am to 640am. Grrr. At least they emailed me and informed my hotel the afternoon before. Note though: domestic flying is cheaper if you fly into Madagascar with them. I didn't, given their spotty record and flying from Canada to Madagascar on a tight time line."
Air Malawi,"Not Verified|   I arrived in Lilongwe for a work training we were facilitating and spent one night in Lilongwe and proceeded to Blantyre the following Monday afternoon. When I arrived at Crossroads hotel, where would stay until the coming Saturday morning, I realized I did not have my passport wallet with forex, and most importantly my passport and an older one. I immediately alerted the hotel and the driver said he would check. By the time I got to my room, there was a message from Victor the Airport Manager who tried calling on watsap, so I immediately responded. He assured me they had everything and the next morning I went to collect it. Sure enough every last note was still there. I waited for a security officer to confirm that nothing was missing and signed off. The honesty, kindness and sheer humanity displayed was so moving. I am deeply grateful to Angel for her assistance and the Airport Manager. You guys are really incredible."
Air Malawi,"Air Malawi brands its self as ""Africa's friendly airline""!? I live in Kenya and my mother was coming from the UK to Blantyre via Nairobi. She was booked on a Saturday flight to Blantyre via Lilongwe from Nairobi. On the Friday we found that Air Malawi had cancelled the flight (without thinking to tell us). When I contacted them they said there was a flight on the Monday but it was full so they rebooked her for the Wednesday flight. As she was going to Malawi for 2 weeks this would have made her trip very short. Finally I managed to get her on the monday flight. Air Malawi have two scheduled flights a week from Nairobi to Lilongwe. Monday and Friday. But they book people for all seven days of the week. If enough people book they fly if they don't they cancel the flight. The thing that really annoyed me was that I chose to use Air Malawi because they told me they fly every day. If I had known the truth I would have used Kenya Airways who admit they have only two flights a week. The second thing that annoyed me was that there was not even a hint of an apology from them for cancelling the flight. If you are trying to go to Malawi my advice is to use Kenya Airways. They are more expensive - but they will get you there when they say you will and if they can't at least they will say sorry!"
Air Malawi,"A very pleasant airline that tries hard despite being the national carrier of a very poor country with only 3 planes. The service on the 737 is equal to SAA. The domestic flight on a Cessna Caravan between Blantyre and Club Mak was perhaps the most fun flight I have ever undertaken. The pilot flew low so we could look at the scenery and even made several detours to look at herds of elephants and hippos. Service on this flight was understandably limited to a ""help yourself"" cooler filled with soft drinks but too busy looking out the windows anyway."
Air Malta,"✅Trip Verified|  I had booked several months ago and my e-ticket included 10kg luggage. When I arrived at the gate in Malta, the staff told me that their rules had changed and the flights no longer include free baggage. I showed them my booking but they would not accept it. Many other customers had the same issue and we all complained. Finally the staff had to call security guards over to restore order as people all complained. Terrible experience that cost me 40 Euro on top of what I had booked. Stay away from this airline."
Air Malta,"✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline experience ever. I booked a round trip flight with Air Malta in September. It was the worst experience I've ever had with any airline. My flight into Rome was delayed. I arrived at the gate to depart for Malta and the plane was still there. The doors were closed, however, and the representatives at the gate and they would not let me board. Fair enough as the doors were closed. Unacceptably, however, they offered zero assistance and ignored me. They did not ""all but"" ignore me. They ignored me. The woman literally grabbed her purse and walked away without offering any help. I went to the counter back at check in and the woman there said she could only help with luggage issues, not tickets. She said I'd have to wait for the next attendant to arrive at 9 pm that night (it was mid-morning). I booked a flight on ITA and got to Malta. I tried multiple times to contact the airline but no one ever answered their phone. I sat on hold forever. The concierge at my hotel also tried to call but likewise had no success, just sat on hold. The website, as others have noted, is useless and would not allow me to even access my reservation (it also would not allow me access before I departed the US after learning that my flight was going to be delayed, fwiw). When I arrived at the airport a few days later to return home, I was told my ticket had been cancelled. Not just the flight to Malta, but the entire round trip. They never sent me any notice: no email, no text, nothing, just ""surprise"" when I got to the airport. I was then billed almost 4 times what I originally paid for the exact same seat on the exact same flight! No apologies and no refund offered for the first part. Since that time, I have attempted numerous times to get a refund for part of what I paid. Nothing but a form response saying no without explanation. The website says flights cancelled more than 24 hours before will be refunded (mine was cancelled by them well outside that window) but they do not even acknowledge that this is their policy.  But for the fact that I actually saw the airplanes and they did get me from Malta back to Rome, I'd say it is a giant scam. Worst customer service ever seems inappropriate because, per above, I do not think they actually offer any customer service, just a dead-end telephone number, a dead-end email address that send form responses, and a dead-end website that you can't actually access after making payment."
Air Malta,"✅Trip Verified|  In October 2023, I was supposed to fly from Malta to Tel Aviv, but the airline cancelled the flight due to the Israel-Hamas war. Consequently, I had to extend my stay in the hotel by two nights, book a different and more expensive flight with Air Malta to Larnaca, Cyprus, and take another flight back to Israel from there with a different airline. The two additional nights in the hotel, the fare difference between the original and new flight and the additional flight back to Israel cost me nearly EUR 1,000. Not only that, when I booked the new flight to Larnaca, I requested 2 additional check-in bags similar to the original flight that was cancelled. I was told each bag would be EUR 40 each. Only after booking the new flight, I was told that in fact the ticket they sold me was operated by a different airline (Emirates), and that I can only pay for the additional baggage at the airport before the flight. Imagine my shock when checking in at the airport, Emirates charged me EUR 237 per additional bag!! I was told the EUR 40 per bag was not correct. I was left with no alternative but to pay the outrageous extra cost or leave my luggage behind. I contacted Air Malta several times via email, they never responded. Avoid this airline at all cost!"
Air Malta,"Not Verified|  01-Sep-2023 flight from UK to Malta delayed 2 hours. Impact got to accommodation 2am. 02-Sep-2023 flight from UK to Malta delayed 3 hours. Impact missed seeing family in Malta before connecting flight departed. 02-Sep-2023 flight from Malta to Palermo delayed 4 hours. Impact car rental closed. Arrived at accommodation 3am. Having to pay 40 EUR for taxis. Claiming under EU 261. 10-Sep-2023 flight from Malta to UK. They have removed my wife from the booking because she flew a day early on 01-Sep-2023 and claimed she was a no show on the original flight on 02–Sep-2023. We requested her to be re-added to the flight. We were promised a call back within 1 hour. We never got a call back and have been unable to get through on the phone all day. Impact we had to book a new flight with EasyJet costing 550 EUR. The flight is departing at 2:30am so we won’t get any sleep. We cancelled 2x flights in June for future trips and we are eligible for 50% refund. After months of chasing we still don’t have the refund. We are questioning Air Malta’s solvency at the moment and we won’t be booking any future flights for fear of Air Malta going bankrupt along with the incredibly poor, stressful and expensive experience."
Air Malta,Not Verified|  All flights were on time and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. On board snacks to buy were good value. Seat pitch good average. Last year we few with this company from Madrid to Malta and return. Both flights very good.
Air Malta,"✅Trip Verified|  Overall, the experience was not good. The outbound flight from LHR to MLA was delayed 2 hours and the return segment was delayed 1 hour on the screen but in reality we arrived back 1.5 hours late. Very limited information re delay and no real apology for it. On both legs I paid for and selected seats at the time of booking and on checking in found that we had been moved 10 rows back on both legs, there was no prior notification of this and no apology. I don't know why I paid to select specific seats at the time of booking if I was not provided these. Overall not a great experience. Other family members also travelled to Malta at the same time to join our holiday and flew on EasyJet and Ryanair, their flights were on time and they received the seats they paid for. My reason for selecting Air Malta was the convivence of flying from LHR which is much closer to me, in reality with the delay I could have travelled on public transport from Gatwick and been home at the same time by travelling on a so called ""low cost carrier"" with what it would seem is a much better overall experience. Onboard the service was fine and the cabin was fine my disappointment was only in relation to above. The fare I would describe as reasonable because I booked 7 months in advance so on par with other carriers."
Air Malta,"✅Trip Verified|  At the check-in in Vienna the clerk called Air Malta to check if I could travel with my sailing life jacket which contains a 22g CO2 cartridge. He confirmed that Air Malta granted permission for this. I then asked the check-in clerk to confirm with the captain that this was ok. He came back to me say that the captain had given his permission. I flew to Malta and my bag was not on the conveyor on arrival. I found out two days later by sending my wife to Vienna Airport that security in Vienna found the CO2 cartridge and asked Air Malta if they can release it. Air Malta declined and my bag was confiscated. My wife managed to access the bag, and after removing my life jacket the bag was flown to Malta. Not only did Air Malta not honour their agreement to carry my bag, but they did not inform me of what had happened. To make things worse, after trying more than 30 times - all day in fact - to call Air Malta I did not succeed in getting any information. I was never informed as to what had happened. Without sending someone to Vienna airport at great inconvenience I would never have known what happened to my Bag."
Air Malta,"Not Verified|  The flight we took was initially delayed twice, and then cancelled afterwards, making us lose the second flight from Amsterdam to New York. Therefore, as per EU regulation, we are entitled to compensation (600 euros each for two people), which they acknowledge. After having sent the bank wire details on the 17th of April, regardless the several call occurred, they still did not complete the payment without providing any kind of reason for the delay. At this point, after all this time, seems clear that their decision is not to pay at all and to wait until they will become a new entity (as has been announced over the media)."
Air Malta,"✅Trip Verified|  Aircraft changes are normal these days. Flight experience ok, nothing to say against it. Industry standard seat pitch, inflight food and drinks. Very good fare.  But my emergency extra legroom reservation was not respected, only the seat number. I was asked if I have reserved 13D, but they did not mention that this is no emergency row anymore. So losing three of my points. Beside the badly trained check-in staff, I do not understand why an airline with one airplane type is giving to some few planes other row numbers for emergency rows, when selling them for higher fees."
Air Malta,"Not Verified| Worst flying experience ever. We have to wait 17 hours to get back home. We sleep on floors but then security comes and tells us we’re not even allowed to sit on the floor. They want us to stand for 17 hours? On the flight from Vienna to Malta we weren’t even offered drinks and I don’t mean free drinks but not even an option that we could buy them. If you want to travel with Air Malta don’t do it. Save your time, money and everything. If you still want to go beware that you going to end up in trouble."
Air Mauritius,"✅Trip Verified|   Booked 2 refundable, business class tickets. A few days before departure one of the passengers had a stroke. Cancelled our tickets and now still waiting for the refund (November 2024). Emails go unanswered as do phone calls. Seems we are not the only ones, there is even a dedicated Facebook page entitled ""Air Mauritius refund us"". We booked through Expedia, but it is the airline who takes from your credit card not the agent. No refund from Expedia and too late to open a credit card dispute as tickets were purchased in April 2024."
Air Mauritius,"Not Verified| 
We flew business class with this airline from Gatwick to Mauritius and back. The plane left about 20 minutes late both ways but arrived on time. The business class seats were really good, even for someone who is on the large size. The seats go down into a bed and you are give a sort of mattress to go over your seat, a pillow and also a duvet. I slept quite well for about 5 hours on the 12 hour flight. The flight attendants were very nice and were willing to go the extra mile to make you happy. The only negatives are that the meals were quite plain and there was not enough water being handed out. I had to keep asking for water. All in all, I would give this airline 4 starts out of 5."
Air Mauritius,✅Trip Verified| Do not fly Air Mauritius - go for South Africa Airlines. This airline is so bad they canceled the flight 3 times. I have to stay for 2 days in Mauritius. I lost my hotel resvation in Johannesburg plus my business meeting and my transportation from airport. Full of rubbish
Air Mauritius,"✅Trip Verified|   Lousy application that didn't allow me to choose my seats before check-in and that required long loading times and unnecessary checks for each manoeuvre. Chaotic boarding process, with an announcement that boarding would start in twenty minutes, only for boarding to start less than five minutes later, forcing me to run back through the airport (I'd gone to buy a bottle of water). The A350 was modern and clean, with large, bright screens, and we're provided with a plaid and headphones of mediocre quality (bring your own as always), while the seats lack a little comfort and legroom, even though I'm far from being very tall. Basic, tasteless meals, deplorable service with a stewardess who seemed to be in a hurry even though it was a long-haul flight. In fact, she spilled tea all over me as she was trying to go too fast, without any real apology and blaming the container when she was clearly at fault. Rather decent choice of films, but no French subtitles on offer - it's either original voices or french dub. It's not too bad, but it's strange all the same. Music selection of little interest, and the same goes for the games, some of which are unplayable. Disembarkation at CDG in buses, not necessarily the airline's fault, but annoying to have to spend a good ten minutes in a bus after a long-haul flight."
Air Mauritius,"✅Trip Verified|   Easy check in and security. Lounge is fine but food options were less appealing. On time boarding. The A350 buisness class is better in my view than A330. Seats a touch wider which made a big difference. Dinner was fine. Bed which included mattress topper was good. I slept for 8.5 hours. Woke over Crete. Breakfast was good. On time arrival. Luggage off quickly Sound mid range product, I would use again"
Air Mauritius,"✅Trip Verified|  PER to MRU. Efficient check in at Perth Airport. Air Mauritius provides access to the Aspire Lounge at Perth which is actually a very good (albeit open access) lounge. Aircraft was delayed due to delayed connecting passengers. Boarding was around 45 minutes late. Aircraft quite modern, clean and well presented. Good amenity kits. Welcome drinks served. Business class seat is a standard lie flat but works well. On the shorter routes (like this) they don't provide a mattress topper. Lunch and drinks served after take off. Food was good (smoked salmon starter and lamb main). Reasonably selection of IFE. Staff responded quickly to any calls. I managed a few hours sleep. Afternoon tea served prior to arrival. For an 8 hours and 50 minute flight, the offering was a little limited and not presented with much flair. Arrival was delayed and though off aircraft quickly, immigration was slow. Luggage waiting for us when we had cleared immigration. My feeling is this represents a solid mid range business product."
Air Mauritius,"✅Trip Verified| Easy check in at Gatwick. They use the club rooms lounge which was fine. Prompt boarding and beverage served. One hour delay managed well by crew who served further drinks and snacks. During flight, beverage good. There is a strong emphasis on fish in meals. It was fine, I just don’t like fish. Slept well on lie flat, mattress topper was very good. Breakfast good, their orange juice was excellent. Easy disembarking and luggage off quickly."
Air Mauritius,"✅Trip Verified|  I recently had the most appalling experience with Air Mauritius on my journey from Delhi to Mauritius, transiting through Delhi. My transit time in Delhi was 18 hours, and I was denied access to the terminal where lounges, restaurants, and hotels are located. Despite being pregnant, I was told I could only enter if registered by Air Mauritius personnel, who were arriving just 2 hours before departure.  Just 3 hours before departure, an Air Mauritius manager finally arrived and demanded proof of my pregnancy status. Despite presenting a document from my doctor stating I was in good health to fly, I was initially denied boarding and told to buy a ticket back to Kazakhstan. The lack of clear communication and understanding was appalling. After enduring immense stress, nervousness, and the additional expense of purchasing a new ticket, I was issued a boarding pass to Mauritius just an hour before departure. The Air Mauritius staff were rude and indifferent to my situation. They refused to provide a phone to contact the Kazakhstani embassy. In summary, my experience with Air Mauritius was horrific."
Air Mauritius,✅Trip Verified|  It is extremely deceitful to charge me for changing my seat (when checking in) under the pretense of an “extra comfort” seat. I have experienced this behavior from air Mauritius for the past 4 months consistently and would like to understand why you are deceiving your customers in this manner and let others know that the costs for the seat changes are not justified. All seats on your planes are the same and not extra comfort as claimed.
Air Mauritius,"Not Verified| The airline failed to adhere to scheduled departure times, leaving passengers stranded at boarding gates. Extended delays during boarding exacerbate the situation, increasing the likelihood of missed connecting flights. It is strongly advised to steer clear of this airline to prevent potential travel disruptions and inconvenience."
Air Mediterranee,"✅Trip Verified|   We boarded on time but we had 1 hour delay due to traffic at ATH, get too hot so crew open doors again and served water. Plane was nice and clean. Crew were very friendly. We landed with half an hour delay. Nice inflight service for 1h45m flight"
Air Mediterranee,The aircraft was on time from Manchester and on the return journey from Lourdes (Bartres) the aircraft left early. The staff were a bit distant the food good overall OK.
Air Mediterranee,TLV-TLS. Flights were on time the plane was clean inside and the seats were comfortable but there was not enough legroom. The crew were very friendly and professional. We got tasty sandwiches and drinks. Take off and landing were excellent. We will recommend.
Air Mediterranee,Glasgow to Lourdes this journey proved all the negative reviews I had read about this airline to be spot on. Plane arrived at Glasgow four hours late after which we eventually boarded. Our troubles were just about to begin. After counting the passengers on the plane at least half a dozen times the cabin crew asked passengers sitting in the front seats to move to the back Caused great inconvenience and lost time. We arrived at our destination approx seven hours late - and five hours late going home.
Air Mediterranee,"Paris to Tel Aviv with group of around 35 (charter) no problems. Return a week later - big problems. Flight due to leave around 2100 delayed as plane had not yet left Paris. No explanation. After several false starts finally informed no flight until next day. Agency found us a hotel (very good). Next day after a few time changes finally left at 1930. Explanation of previous day's problem: mechanical and crew unavailability. Crew aboard our flight ""volunteered"". Good people lousy company. Too small and probably not profitable enough to meet obligations. Surely destined to close shop before long."
Air Mediterranee,"For a return flight from Paris to Mopti Air Mediterranee proved horrible from start to end. Despite several calls to their customer service center in Paris no-one could tell us what time the flight left nor from what Paris airport. In the end the flight left one day before its originally scheduled departure in the afternoon from Orly instead of CDG the originally announced airport. The leg-room in the completely full flight was pitiful and as a woman a little above the average European standard my legs were constantly hitting the back of the person in front of me. In spite of the trials of the flight to Mopti the worst part of the flight was still the return. Calling the airline on the day before departure they could tell us departure time was moved from 0900 to 1200. No information would have been given to us had we not called. However the airline still insisted we would have to be there at 0600 for check-in. Calling a second time on the day of departure they told us it was sufficient to be there at 1030 because the flight would ""probably not leave"" before 1400 anyway. Treated like kettle just as we had been in the departure hall of CDG on the day down we were held in various queues most in the scorching sun until the crew decided to let us on board a little after 14. Many people having waited since 6 that morning were getting hungry by this stage and this is when it turned out Air Mediterranee had not provisioned for sufficient food for the journey. For a trip lasting 8 hours including an un-announced fuel stop in Algeria we were served the following: one tin containing 150 ml of salad one tin containing 150 ml of apple puree a stale muffin and a glass of water or juice. No bread no coffee no hot meal no second meal. Despite the pitiful amounts of food several passengers still had business to do in the toilets. Unfortunately there was no water in the toilets which soon became a no-go zone so dreadful only thinking about still makes me sick today. Arriving in CDG around mid- night starving with all shops closed having missed my flight out of Paris and longing for a clean toilet I swore never to use Air Mediterranee again."
Air Memphis,Had booked for the wife and I to go to Luxor for the day booked in advance through Thomson holidays. I thought it would be Egyptair but getting onboard found out it was an Air Memphis MD-83. On entering the plane you could see how old it was old seats equipment etc. It stank of aviation fuel at the back which is where we were sitting. It was only a 30 minute flight to Luxor but I was so glad that is all it was. It was ok and they gave out little cartons of juice to take up the time.
Air Memphis,We booked a day trip to Luxor from Sharm and flew Air Memphis. Aircraft was an old MD83 which was tired looking inside and out but clean. Friendly cabin crew juice and a snack were served. Don't let appearances put you off.
Air Memphis,My mother and I flew from Sharm to Cairo return. I thought we would be boarding an Egyptair flight - unfortunately not. We boarded through the back of the plane as we walked to our seats another passenger sat down only to find a piece of metal had come apart from the seat. Most of the seats were held together with duct tape. Never again.
Air Memphis,Belgrade to Hurghada on a charter flight. Old plane non-existent leg space cold food and dated biscuits. Only good thing I can say about them is that the cabin crew were nice.
Air Memphis,"Totally agree with all of the comments below. We travelled from Sharm to Cairo and back again on a day trip booked through Thomas Cook. Cannot believe a company with such a good reputation would use this airline. We are not nervous travellers normally but I was convinced we would not make it back in one piece. My husband described it as ""a rollercoster on wings"". Really bad smell of fuel almost no safety demonstration broken seats the staff were arm-wresting each other on take-off (not very professional!) the plane was so old. The scariest experience of our lives."
Air Memphis,We've made a return flight Paris - Marsa Alam on an A320. I have to say that crew were all very kind playing with children smiling. It's quite rare to see warm food in a charter flight even though the food was forgettable. Seats seem to be refurbished. Mine during the first flight was broken and I was always on recline position even during take-off. Return flight an A320 with no sign on the tail the space for legs was a shame.
Air Memphis,We flew Air Memphis from Milan to Hurghada with our 4 month old son. The baby pushchair was broken while handled by airline staff and we are still waiting for an answer from Air Memphis who play dead. Apart from this behaviour food terrible staff unpleasant and unhelpful. No baby cot like any decent airline - even though we had been promised one - on a night flight meant that baby slept on our laps and we stayed awake.
Air Memphis,Luxor via Sharm to Manchester on A320 after Monarch refused to let me and my 8 year old daughter board with Kiss Flights tickets. There were 13 of us stranded at Luxor and about 70 more in Sharm so we only half filled the plane. The crew was friendly professional and sympathetic to the fact we had been delayed for a further 4 hours. Whilst the plane was obviously quite new the seats were refurb in my opinion but we had plenty of leg room a very pleasant but simple dinner - no alcohol on board - but drinks free with our meal unlike Monarch who only give coffee free. As soon as we had eaten and duty free had been up and down the lights were dimmed as it was very late. Air Memphis may be budget domestic flights but their international flight for me and my companions on board I thinks was excellent.
Air Memphis,My son and I flew Air Memphis from Hurghada to Cairo (and the return flight) in August 2010. Like most people I had expected an Egyptair plane and was surprised to see Air Memphis as I had never heard of them. I too noticed a pool of some liquid under the plane as we went up the steps to board but gave it little more thought. The flight up to Cairo was on a relatively new Airbus but it had the same problems of broken seats overhead lockers etc. The person sitting next to me was on her own and obviously a nervous flier at the best of times and she had kittens when the locker above her flew open mid flight! Other than that the flight was uneventful we were offered but politely refused the date biscuits and carton of drink as they looked like they had been offered round many times previously. The flight back was on an ageing MD83 I have never liked flying on planes where the engines are mounted at the back either side of the tail.
Air Memphis,I flew Air Memphis Luxor to Abu Simbel on a very ancient Romanian built BAC 111. Frightening on way out even worse when we landed back at Luxor - we were still deplaning onto a ferry bus when the pilot and engineer used a car jack to replace one of the front wheels that had a very bald tyre in front of all passengers. Never again.
Air Moldova,"Not Verified|  Do not book with this airline. Booked to go to Baku for the f1. They cancelled the flight with 4 days notice, offered no alternative. so was forced to book another flight at a much higher cost to get to Baku. Air Moldova know they cannot run their flight schedule, but sell tickets anyway. They then cancel with late notice, and do not offer any refunds. I have called, emailed, tweeted, FB messaged etc, no reply. This is a very simple scam, and very common, beware and do not use them."
Air Moldova,Not Verified|  Air Moldova cancelled my flight 3 days after taking money out of account. I found it really difficult to get anyone to engage with me and eventually they offered me a voucher to the ticket price. I refused this as I do not intend to use the airline ever again. they said there is a '€70 penalty' to take cash refund so I would only receive €6!
Air Moldova,"✅Trip Verified|  I tried to fly from Istanbul to Lisbon as I received a job offer. I had in hands: house contract, work contract signed from both parties, invitation letter from the company and even a document from the Portuguese Consulate authorizing my arrival. But yet, they have decided not to let me board with the excuse I need a visa. I am Brazilian, I don't need a visa anywhere in Europe, let alone Portugal. I've waited for about 4 hours until they decide to officially not let me board. The counter guy was absurdly unprofessional. The manager wasn't so bad. But then they tell me I need to contact an email or call some weird number that never picked up. And No one ever replied to my email attempts. I called the offices in Istanbul, Lisbon and Chisinau and none of them helped with anything. 230 euros on the trash. So trust me: they will coast you more than any other more expensive but trust able ticket."
Air Moldova,"✅Trip Verified|  Don't buy a ticket with them, they cancelled my flight a week before my travel offering me to fly 4 days later. I asked for a refund and they told me that they would refund 27 euro out of 112 euro (wonder why only 27 euro), anyway they never refunded me anything. Sent them at least 50 emails, they never replied and tried to call them, same problem never answering the phone. I have been waiting 1h on the phone and no one never answered. Don't buy a ticket with them. No help at all and no customer service and the worst is that they will never refund you."
Air Moldova,"Not Verified|  
Prior to flight it was a struggle to book mobility assistance for my half blind mum. Eventually I booked it and received confirmation. No assistance was provided in Chisinau for her to catch connecting flight with only 40 min to do it. She struggled on her own. I will never book them again."
Air Moldova,"✅Trip Verified|  Tel Aviv to Chisinau. They can cancel your flight any time, and if you will ask for a refund they will not accept. Try to avoid them, they only care for money. I had the worst experience with them, I waited at the airport 13 hours to take another flight instead. I will never ever fly will them again."
Air Moldova,"Not Verified|  Very inflexible in giving me the dates I wanted to reschedule because of the Coronavirus pandemic, when I reschedule the dates I wanted to they gave me the dates I didn’t want to go, and I ask them for the dates I wanted and they said it was not possible for me to change the booking for those dates."
Air Moldova,"Not Verified|  Chisenau was our layover stop between London and Krasnodar and our plane with Air Moldova was delayed for a substantial amount of time, leaving us worried that we would miss our next flight. However, we were able to board our plane to Krasnodar, thanks to the staff at Air Moldova. Knowing that we, along with a couple of other passengers, were getting close to missing our next plane, the cabin staff ensured that we were the first to disembark the plane. Once at the Chisenau airport, staff took us directly to our next plane, which would have taken us much longer if the kind staff had not taken us via the quickest route. Without them, we would have definitely missed our flight."
Air Moldova,"✅Trip Verified|  Chisinau to Paris. Awful customer service! Because the autofill on the pc had a mistake in my name and they told me that the correction is €90 that I understand but the lady got moody and said that there are no more seats. If i want to leave magically they will find an empty seat if i pay the full price ticket €250, and they gave me the same seat that i reserved at the beginning. I literally saw in my ticket after they printed it that they charged me for the name correction €90 and the charged me for an upgrade that I didn’t ask €160 - because otherwise they will not allow me to board."
Air Moldova,"✅Trip Verified| Moscow Domodedovo to Chisinau. I've been using services of Air Moldova already for 3 years and I have a very positive impression. Airplanes are in good condition, come on time and the service is great. Especially, I would like to point out excellent work of online help service of Online Booking. I made a mistake choosing the date of flight and noticed it only after order has been placed. The operator gave me a fast reply to my email and was very friendly and helpful, so we could correct the date to the right one. So the problem was solved within minutes. Excellent work! Totally recommend to use this airline."
Air Montenegro,"✅Trip Verified|   I was very hesitant to book Air Montenegro because the company only has two aircraft which can cause problems. But it was the only direct flight. I also watched a Youtube video from the same route and it really didn’t impress. The check in at Tivat was messy with no priority line (even though the sign suggested it). No lounge access. No priority boarding. Onboard it was a real joke. The only thing you got was a small bottle of water and some mixed nuts. The flight arrived on time but due to thunderstorms, the baggage took 90 mins to come which of course is not the airline to blame. So the only thing you get is having a seat on the first row and better baggage allowance. Otherwise a pute joke."
Air Montenegro,"✅Trip Verified|  Our flight MNE 330 to Rome, after being delayed for over four hours, was eventually cancelled on Monday 26 February 2024. We were kept waiting for hours without updates. Once the cancellation announcement was finally made, we were made to wait an additional two hours while a single representative dealt with a glut of passengers, a total wait time of six plus hours. While we were offered tickets for the next flight to Rome - not until the following Friday, that option was not feasible because we had a flight from Rome to Toronto on Thursday, the day before. The representative informed us to write to you for a refund of the tickets plus an additional 250 euros per passenger as compensation to cover the cost of making alternate arrangements. We had to take a cab to Tirana the next day, purchase new tickets, and fly from there to Rome. I submitted all receipt, copies of the tickets, and copies of our unused boarding passes to Air Montenegro (as they are now called). The refund for the unused portion came in a reasonable amount of time, but I am still waiting for the promised compensation for the additional costs, two months later. I have followed up by email several times and heard back from no one."
Air Montenegro,"✅Trip Verified|  Clean airplane, departed on time. Crew were professional and friendly. Good announcement from the pilot. Offered a cookie and a bottle of water. No in flight magazine"
Air Montenegro,"✅Trip Verified|  Absolutely unprofessional and uncooperative communication. I have an acoustic guitar that I want to carry from Belgrade to Tivat on a very local, usually uncrowded flight and the answer is nothing less then ""sorry, we don't do that"". So no solution."
Air Namibia,✅Trip Verified| Absolutely useless airline. Cancelled tickets without notification due to aircraft maintenance. No refunds to speak of and promised to refund airfares but the refund has been postponed indefinitely. Lost money on this due to accommodation deposits lost. Do not ever use this airline! Use reputable airlines.
Air Namibia,Not Verified|  Johannesburg to Windhoek. They make abuse of the Coronavirus. Because we cannot go to Namibia at the moment we have to change the dates of our holiday. Air Namibia will charge the normal fee (45 usd per person!) to change the dates! Really unbelievable! KLM already did it for free!
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified|  Johannesburg to Windhoek. We never got on the airplane. Air Namibia sold us the ticket after the gates were closed for boarding. We missed the flight and I've been trying to get our money back since August 2019. They admitted the were wrong, which I've got in writing. They then payed just over half the amount due, now saying we need to pay penalties. If the mistake was with the airline, as admitted, why are the passengers paying for it? It's R2000.00 in penalties. I will never fly with this airline again, as this is not our first bad experience with them. My parents have property in Namibia, so we fly there often. I will rather pay more and avoid this airline at all cost."
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified|  Windhoek to Johannesburg. When checking in at 15H23 for our scheduled flight at 17H30, the assistant at the counter informed me that the flight is delayed. Couldn’t give a departure time, just that the flight from JHB hasn’t left JHB yet, due to a technical problem. And so our waiting of 5 hours 30 minutes started. And the staff wasn’t very informative or helpful. Lounge area disappointing! Plugs don’t work. Totally not up to standard. Our business class experience: seats 2d & 2c The leg/foot rests didn’t work. The food offered was revolting. The flight detail on the onscreen monitor was a joke. I took a photo to show people that we actually flew back in time! “current time 22:05, Estimated Arrival time 20:53”  We’ll never make use of this airline again and won’t recommend it to anyone."
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified|  Windhoek to Frankfurt. After having read reviews I was prepared for bad service and problems during the flight, but luckily everything was fine and I am quite happy with the overall experience. The aircraft is spacious and clean, seats are comfortable and have a pillow and a blanket for each passenger. The crew was 50% very friendly and 50% not so (""good cop, bad cop""). The food was quite good; however, it might have been better, maybe a dessert could be added. Big selection of drinks but only one type of juice (orange). On the long overnight flight, dinner and breakfast have been offered. During the flight, the crew also offered water. The entertainment system is still not working; it seems to be a persistent problem that the airline is not willing to solve."
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified| It was the first time I flew Air Namibia in June 19 in Business Class: thinking it was/would be a good and short flight from Cape Town via Windhoek to Frankfurt in business, but what I then experienced, was definitely not cool. Ok, the total cost/fare I paid was less than other comparable airlines at that point in time: but the fact that first of all my connection flight, from Cape Town to Windhoek, which was originally scheduled to only need about 1 hour for transit, was actually then cancelled. Hence I was advised - just a few days before departure then - to use a flight from Cape Town to Windhoek much earlier, leading to a like a 4 hour stopover on Windhoek. Not what I wanted, and also why I did not take another airline into consideration - then I could already have chosen Ethiopian or Turkish etc with a similar stopover time. Anyhow: so: the lounge in Windhoek is not a business lounge-like anywhere else in the world. It is so bad: no proper food, not adequate seats, no service - nothing, not even adequate toilets. Ok, the beer is ok - if that is what you need to survive. Now back to the plane: The service is more than just reasonable - nothing special - but for sure not business class standard. The seats are worn out - but I must admit flat seat at least. But that is basically all I can say positively. All the rest is not business class-related and feeling old. Food, just ok, hardly any selection of drinks and the worst thing: I do not know what really happened to my luggage: it arrived - ok - but in such bad condition. I hardly have ever seen before. So I must assume and believe that happened during the long transfer/transit in Windhoek as described above (as I travel a lot from and to Cape Town) but this trip definitely did wear out my luggage."
Air Namibia,"Not Verified|  We travelled on Air Namibia after our travel company arranged substitute flights to Victoria Falls due to our Virgin Atlantic plane being delayed from London resulting in us missing our connection. Virgin were very unhelpful offering a new flight 2 days later! The trip with Air Namibia was excellent from start to finish. The crew were very friendly on board, the food was nice. When we landed at Windhoek the ground staff were very helpful ensuring our bags continued the journey and we were kept informed."
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified|  This is the worst airline I have ever flown with and their customer service is even worse. Less than 24 hours before I was due to fly I received an email from them informing me that these time of my flight would be changing and would now be 3 hours later. This would mean that I would miss my connecting flight, which they were well away of. I spent the rest of the day trying to sort it out, even going to the Air Namibia offices in Windhoek but everyone I spoke to promised to call me back and never did. Eventually, less than 12 hours before my flight I got a reply to tell me they couldn't do anything. I had to spend a night in Johannesburg, booking into a hotel, at my own expense and arrived at my destination a day late. I have since written to Air Namibia on a number of occasions, and not received one reply. This company is appalling, apparently I have since heard that they have a reputation for this sort of thing."
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified|  Cape Town to Windhoek. I am in total shock and horror. The communication channels for Air Namibia are incredibly inefficient. I have tried to call 8 numbers to try re-route a ticket, and there has been no connectivity or no answer from Cape Town offices, Johannesburg offices and even Namibia's offices (including head office).  This is unbelievably unacceptable? I was on hold at the call centre for 30 mins, ad the website's refund policies do not load. An empty box appears, making it very difficult for us to invest in a ticket change without certainty. I have never flown with Air Namibia before, but I have had countless flights in my life, and changed tickets and routes many times - and it has never proven to be so long, tedious and inefficient. Please could you work on making sure your communication channels are more efficient to ensure a seamless customer experience."
Air Namibia,"✅Trip Verified| Cape Town to Windhoek. Overall it was a very pleasant flight experience. The staff at the check-in counter were very helpful to change us to our desired seats because we had to check-in at the webpage of another airline (codeshare). The seats were comfortable with an average seat-pitch. On board were three options of meal: Chicken, Beef and Fish. We had forgotten to order a vegetarian meal. But the staff prepared us a vegetarian mean from the sides of the other meals. In generall al staff of Air Namibia, with whom we were in contact were very friendly and helpful."
Air New Zealand,Not Verified|  This quick and easy flight was made so enjoyable by the inflight quiz that Air New Zealand have on their short-haul flights. Nice inflight snacks and great crew.
Air New Zealand,Not Verified|  The ground service was frankly rubbish. We were late because the PA system was broken. The inflight entertainment was so small that EasyJet would have more inflight entertainment than this. No inflight snacks. Not happy.
Air New Zealand,"Not Verified| This long-haul Air New Zealand flight was so much better than previous Air New Zealand flights. I was in Economy stretch with a lot of legroom. If you want to go Economy stretch I think you should. Ground staff were really nice, cabin crew were nice and it was a quick flight time. I think Air New Zealand should have a Quiz channel because on their short-haul flights, they have a Quiz so I think on the entertainment screen they should have a channel just for Quizzes. Overall, Good flight, nice crew and soft seat for Economy Stretch. Good legroom."
Air New Zealand,"✅Trip Verified|   I made a $6,350 payment to Air New Zealand. They can't find the payment. It has been 5 days and they still haven't given me any information.   I have now had to pay my bank a fee to cary out an investigation into the ""missing"" funds which could take weeks."
Air New Zealand,Not Verified| Air New Zealand short haul is brilliant. The crew service was brilliant. There was also a quiz on the plane for the whole flight. Very quick flight time after the plane was late coming in from the previous destination. Brilliant quick flight
Air New Zealand,"✅Trip Verified|   We were due to take flight NZ 902 to Papeete arriving at 01.35 on 8 April 2024. 30 minutes into flight, our aircraft returned to Auckland due to hydraulic issues. The flight was rescheduled for 24 hours later arriving Papeete 02.35 on 9 April. Our cruise ship had sailed the previous evening at 18.00. The service & care shown from Air New Zealand was appalling. The ground crew could not care a less. We were told to walk with our cases 2km from the airport to pick up a bus service to transfer us to a designated hotel without any assistance from ANZ staff. Our flight service from Perth was carried out by Wamos Airlines operated by a Spanish crew. The safety instructions were inaudible, & contravene the CAA regulations. We gathered on our return that ANZ were grappling with worldwide maintenance checks on their engines. ANZ General Manager called the arrangements with Wamos was a proactive, temporary measure to avoid major flight cancellations, although the problems were not just confined to the Perth Auckland route Our flight to Papeete, Air New Zealand were aware of the issue before departure because a technician was aboard working in the cockpit. Air New Zealand were not interested in redressing any additional costs which we incurred in trying to meet our ship in the next port This is the first & last time we will travel with this carrier. Air New Zealand are unprofessional & show a total lack of care for their customers. In our opinion they are an extremely poor Company. Our rating for this airline is 0/10, as is value for money & ground crew If you travel with this airline you have been warned."
Air New Zealand,"✅Trip Verified|   We always try to fly on Singapore Airlines as they are our favourite airline. We travelled to Germany via Singapore on August 15 and returned on September 5 arriving in Auckland on September 7. Both legs to Frankfurt from Auckland and the return leg from Frankfurt to Singapore were on Singapore Airlines in Business Class. Totally superb with large seats, great beds, personal privacy and plenty of floor storage of carry on luggage under the seat in front. Great service. Just perfect. Our last leg was a code share with Air NZ. While the staff were great the Business Class seats were appalling. Cramped, no storage space on the floor, little privacy as the layout pointed you directly towards the passenger across the aisle. There was a large bulkhead next to the seat that intruded on the space.The bed was difficult to set up and put back and very cramped. The tiny foot rest was partially in the aisle and people moving past had to be careful not to trip over it. We had never flown Air NZ Business Class before and have no desire to do it again. It is more like a glorified Economy Class seat with a bit of extra room. Business Class travel is not cheap. Until the airline does a serious upgrade (which we understand they are starting) we would rather wait a few hours extra in Singapore to do all our travel legs on Singapore Airlines."
Air New Zealand,Not Verified|  Such a lovely experience! Service was so good and food was delicious! The cabin crew were so nice and lovely. Would definitely fly with this airline again.
Air New Zealand,"Not Verified| I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Air New Zealand, and I feel compelled to share it to help future travelers make informed decisions. My ordeal began with an extended delay at the airport that quickly turned into an overnight stay, largely due to the airline's lack of communication and support. Initially, our flight was delayed, and after waiting for about four hours, it was eventually canceled. Throughout this period, there was minimal information provided about the situation, leaving passengers confused and frustrated. To add to the inconvenience, the airline offered no immediate assistance in rebooking our flight, which only compounded the stress of the situation. While Air New Zealand did provide hotel and meal vouchers, the experience with these compensations was far from satisfactory. The hotel we were directed to did not accept the vouchers due to delays in payment processing by the airline. This left us scrambling for alternative accommodations and additional expenses. The next leg of our journey was similarly marred by issues. The second flight was delayed again, this time due to a broken plane. The airline had to find a new aircraft and transfer catering, further prolonging our travel experience and adding to the frustration. One of the most frustrating aspects of this ordeal has been the difficulty in resolving the financial implications of the delays. Efforts to seek reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses on hotels and meals were met with a series of excuses, slow responses, and an overall lack of effective communication. Reaching a customer service representative was challenging, and when contact was made, responses were often unhelpful and evasive. Overall, my experience with Air New Zealand was far from satisfactory. The combination of poor communication, inadequate support, and slow reimbursement processes has left a lasting negative impression. For anyone considering flying with Air New Zealand, I recommend being prepared for potential disruptions and ensuring you have a contingency plan in place."
Air New Zealand,"Not Verified| I was honestly quite surprised about Air New Zealand! Take note that this was a domestic flight. First up, the legroom was huge. I could literally stretch my legs! Very surprising because it is an A320. Cabin crew came round and bought some snacks, including this new Zealand based cookie, which was delicious. Loved the service, would fly Air NZ again."
Air Niugini,"✅Trip Verified|   My trip from Auckland, New Zealand to Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, included flights handled by Qantas and Air Niugini, all of which were booked through a travel agent in New Zealand (Flight Centre). The issues began when my flight from Port Moresby to Rabaul was canceled with only 13 hours’ notice. By that time, we had already checked in at Auckland and were boarding the plane, leaving us with no other option but to continue the journey. Air Niugini’s only resolution was to offer us a flight the following day, advising us to simply ""turn up"" at the airport. Upon arriving at the domestic check-in the next day and waiting for over an hour and a half, I was informed that I wasn’t on the flight. Despite this, I was told to speak with customer service, who initially showed no interest in resolving the issue until I had to raise my voice and explain that I was traveling for a family death ceremony. Magically, tickets appeared only 30 minutes before departure, even though I had been told the flight was full. Upon boarding, it was evident that there were at least 10–15 free seats. The lack of communication, transparency, and effort from your staff was shocking and unprofessional. But that was only the beginning. The return flight from Rabaul to Port Moresby, scheduled to depart at 7:00 AM, was abruptly canceled the night before at 11:00 PM via email, with no alternative options provided. The two phone numbers provided in the email for assistance were not even connected. Left with no choice, we arrived at the airport, where we finally received an email at 5:00 AM informing us of rebooking on another flight. However, upon arrival at the airport, the staff could see this new booking but were unable to check us in for over 45 minutes, requiring a phone call to head office to resolve the issue. Adding to the stress, I was traveling with my mother, and being in Rabaul—a remote part of the world with a tiny airport and only one other local airline—we had no real alternative options. The worry of being stranded caused a huge amount of anxiety for both of us, which could have been avoided with better communication and service. This experience has been beyond frustrating and entirely unacceptable for an airline that charges full-price fares for services that you clearly cannot deliver. The rumor that fuel shortages are affecting your ability to operate flights as scheduled yet you continue selling tickets without disclosing these issues is both deceptive and unethical. I expect a formal apology and explanation for the appalling service, as well as reassurance that other passengers won’t have to suffer the same treatment in the future."
Air Niugini,"✅Trip Verified|   A disgrace of an airline. Arrived at check in three hours in advance of departure time just to find out that they had bumped me off the flight. They essentially killed off the second half of my holidays. Check in itself was a farce. Although at the top of the queue, it was a very long wait as counter staff and security let selected people through first who then also make their friends jump the queue. Staff is not very friendly and unapologetic. No explanation was provided why it was me who was there well in advance and had purchased the ticket many months in advance cannot fly. A promised refund can only be requested by email apparently. I am sure I have to fight for that too."
Air Niugini,"Not Verified| This airline is a complete mess! I flew Air Niugini from Honiara to Nadi and oh boy! I have never come across an airline as unreliable as this one. I was initially meant to fly the 737-800 which comes with IFE and charging ports but a day before our trip our aircraft got downgraded to a Fokker-100. When I asked why the aircraft was downgraded they had no answer. The check-in took AGES! A good 10 minute per passenger. The flight was scheduled for 2pm, a day prior I got a text saying the flight will no will leave at 3.40pm. This was updated on the Fiji Airways app but not the Air Niugini app. Anyways to be on the safe side I went to the airport at 12.30 to check in by 1pm. When I got to the airport the screens read 2.55pm as departure. The flight actually left nearly 5pm because of which I missed my onward connection in Nadi. All this while there was no communication on the delay and the reason for the delay. No ground staff in sight in international departure except when it was time to board. I had requested a special meal, that was not loaded so the poor crew had to put something together for me. The crew are literally the saving grace of this airline. They are genuinely passionate about their jobs and they went above and beyond to make every passenger feel welcomed. I give 5 stars to the crew, only to them. Literally the only good thing about this airline."
Air Niugini,"Not Verified| Terrible to fly with. 4 of 4 flights delayed on 1 trip. Lied to by staff AND management. Lost hundreds of dollars, thousands If you include work, all cos of them. There's a lot more but in a nut shell, save yourself the trouble - DONT FLY WITH THEM"
Air Niugini,"✅Trip Verified|  I have booked many flights with Air Niugini. In the specific case, my flight from Honiara to Port Moresby has been Rescheduled (2:30hrs later). Because of this reschedule I will not be able to catch the last flight from Port Moresby to Goroka, and also be obliged to pay an Hotel in Port Moresby. I have written 6 times to AirNiugini Customer Service for a refund: no answer. I was told by friends that this happens very often. We are big travellers (EPS) and it’s important to give the message that this company is totally unreliable!"
Air Niugini,"✅Trip Verified| Flew Air Niugini because of the B767, very nice cabin in a 2x1x2 configuration. Took seat 2A, bulkhead seat, very comfortable with heaps of leg room. Staff were amazing and very attentive, food was OK, entertainment was enough for this flight of approx. 6 hrs."
Air Niugini,"Not Verified|  We flew from Brisbane to Port Morseby and while in POM we had several flights delayed and then completely canceled. We had to stay in POM for two days before finally flying out. We had relatives waiting for us in Popondetta during this time who had to travel a long distance to meet us and wait. Now coming home our flight from Popondetta was over two and a half hours delayed. This means that we will miss the flight from POM to Brisabane, and probably staying another night in POM. Absolutely disgraceful service from this company. Also seems like theirs no way of contacting any of the Air Nuigini offices by phone as you will just sit their on hold like I did today for 40 minutes before I gave up."
Air Niugini,"✅Trip Verified|  Air Niugini has ruined my Easter holiday. I have a holiday reservation at Walindi Plantation Resort, Kimbe, from 7-10/4. I have booked Air Niugini domestic flight from Port Moresby to Hoskins on 7/4. The 7/4 is canceled with a SMS notification at 10am on 7/4, and rescheduled to 8/4 3.25pm, which is fine as it's only one day difference. I check in again for 8/4, and this flight is further delayed to 4.45pm without any notification during the dropping of my luggage at counter, well, which is also fine for me as it's only 1 hour plus delay. Finally when we are supposed to queue up for boarding, at 4.45pm sharp, the airline makes announcement to cancel the flight, and reschedule to the next day 9/4, for departure at ridiculous 4.55am. If you can't afford to operate the flight, just don't take my booking or notify earlier in case of flight change so that we can manage our travel. For what that you still check us in, and get us waiting in the boarding lounge just for your cancellation announcement, instead of a departure. The customer service counter is full of chaos with the staff having no compassion to comfort the frustrated crowds."
Air Niugini,✅Trip Verified| Manila to Brisbane via Port Moresby. Delayed my plane by 36 hours. Wasted 2 days. Had paid for Business class upgrade but “they couldn’t find it in the system. Had no problems keeping the money.
Air Niugini,"Not Verified|  Terrible service. Well over 2 hours to check in, queues have no seats, not even been through security yet. Not a single apology or justification from a member of staff. Oh and they made sure the business customers pushed into the economy queue stands to be seen first."
Air North Yukon's Airline,Not Verified| The airline was fantastic. Left and arrived on time. You get a snack provided by the airline. Very tasty. Would always choose to fly with Air North in the future.
Air North Yukon's Airline,"Not Verified|  I love Air North and use them whenever it's convenient between Kelowna and Vancouver. Very reasonable fares, which includes two checked bags, and advance seat selection for $20. Always on time, friendly staff, and I love the vintage 737's. It's like what flying was like decades ago - much nicer and more relaxed."
Air North Yukon's Airline,✅Trip Verified|  Wonderful airline. Both going to and coming back from Whitehorse I really enjoyed flying with them. Flights were on time. No trouble with checked baggage. Staff were super friendly. They even provided a complimentary sandwich and warm cookie on a flight that was just over two hours! I have a high opinion of this airline and would gladly fly with them again. Thank you Air North!
Air North Yukon's Airline,"Not Verified|  We were totally amazed by their services, since none of us have ever heard of this airline. The trip was arranged by the travel agency who arranged our tour. Even during a short trip they provided us gourmet sandwiches and a warm cookie; while beverages was served twice, which is far much better than what we experienced from those larger airlines. How we wish they can cover more routes."
Air North Yukon's Airline,"Not Verified|  Vancouver to Whitehorse. Air North is a wonderful friendly airline serving the Yukon. Their combination of an older fleet and genuine hospitality makes it the ideal way to get to Canada's beautiful Yukon. There is no IFE on board any of their aircraft which can be a downside for longer trips, but the food is all free and comes is greater quantity then the meal options you pay for on mainline carriers. Air North's flights are finished with a warm cookie service which is always enjoyable. Overall a great airline and great customer service!"
Air North Yukon's Airline,"Air North describes its class of service as ""Yukoner Economy"", which I thought probably referred to a concept of warm-hearted hospitality and generosity. This held true for my first flight in their 737-400, but after flying in the HS748 I'm wondering if the term is actually more about resilience in the face of harsh conditions! Cramped conditions in the HS748 aside, the service overall was pretty good - staff were (almost) all friendly and efficient, flights ran on schedule, and reasonable food was provided. No in-flight entertainment system, but at the time I flew, the stunning ever-changing landscape below was all the entertainment I could want."
Air North Yukon's Airline,YVR-YXY in Economy. Check-in agents were quick and boarding commenced on time. On board the aircraft was old and not well maintained and in need of refurbishment. No inflight entertainment and seat pockets tray table and carpet were dirty. Inflight snacks mediocre. Seat was worn and not comfortable though the pitch seems to be pretty standard with Air Canada. Cabin crew announcements were rushed and inaudible. Service was the highlight and the crew were friendly. Flight arrived on-time and baggage was a short wait.
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified|  Very early flight (6:00 AM). Was booked to allow an immediate connection with MAD-GIG on Iberia (Business class too). However the second leg was cancelled by Iberia months ago, and they booked us to Rio de Janeiro on the following day. Very unfairly, they refused to also move the MRS-MAD leg; petty atitude on Iberia side. is it really worth paying a Business Class ? Therefore we had to spend a night in Madrid, at our expenses."
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified|  Right now, Iberia Regional - Air Nostrum is serving the Madrid - Frankfurt route. I was very happy with their service and the quality of food, beverages in their Business Class. The service was quick and very attentive throughout the flight and even the coffee served was very fresh and tasty (which is usually not a strength of Iberia). Despite of this narrowbody aircraft, seating was comfortable and in Business Class, the seat besides you will be left empty. I can really recommend you this Business Class service on this route with Air Nostrum."
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified| Madrid to Toulouse. Once again a punctual and comfortable flight. Good legroom, on time departure and arrival. On flight entertainment was however not working à you have to pay for anything on board"
Air Nostrum,"Not Verified|  Disappointed with Air Nostrum. Air Nostrum said that due to a change of aircraft, the CRJ 1000 instead of the ATR 72 was not fit to land at San Sebastian airport for technical reasons. How come a bigger aircraft like the A319 of Vueling can land in such airport? They diverted us to Pamplona. The flight was delayed more than 2 hours. Finally in Pamplona they took us in a bus to San Sebastian but instead of using the shortest route by motorway, the bus driver told us he was taking the longer route. I reached my destination almost 3 hours later than I was supposed to."
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Madrid. The Check in for the flight was handled by Royal air Maroc staff, who were 20 mins late in opening check in due to an issue with a previous flight. It was a friday afternoon and only half of the immigration counters were open which resulted in an hour long wait to clear immigration. I wandered down to the boarding gate to wait for our flight. It was time to board but there was no aircraft at the gate. We were provided no infomation by Royal air Maroc ground staff about the flight or expected departure time 18.40. I discovered that the flight had not left Madrid. There was no food vouchers offered, no information provided regarding compensation for flight delays flights to the EU or details about the delay. The flight from Madrid arrived a little under three hours late. We were bussed to the aircraft which was parked some distance away despite having our boarding gate E1 free. The crew apologised for the delay and told us they had to swap an aircraft due to a technical issue. The CRJ 1000 has a narrow cabin and the seat was comfortable but a little tight. There were no complimentary drinks or snacks offered on board by the crew despite the long delay. After landing the aircraft taxied to a remote stand and we were bussed to the the Terminal (4S),. Our allocated baggage carousel was undergoing maintenance and the delivery of the bags was delayed by 15 mins. Overall a very unpleasant experience with Air Nostrum compounded by the poor communication. I arrived at my hotel over 4 hours late"
Air Nostrum,✅Trip Verified|  I booked a return ticket with Air Nostrum and found out that I could travel a day earlier. When I tried to change the ticket the price quoted was twice the price of the ticket I had paid before. I decided to book one sector with another airline and wanted to cancel that sector. The price to not show up for a flight that i paid for was over 100 euro. I could not cancel otherwise and if I would be no show the return ticket will be cancelled. I learned my lesson and will not book tickets with this airline again.
Air Nostrum,✅Trip Verified|  Madrid to Granada. Excellent. Efficient and attentive cabin crew. Arrived and left on time. New aircraft and comfortable seats. Straightforward boarding and disembarking. Highly recommended.
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified|  This flight was reserved weeks ahead of travel and was part of a journey to enable me to travel to London with a connection in Madrid. Firstly the website would not let me check-in online (although I had chosen my seat on the same website) when I reached the airport it transpired that my seat had been changed. I ended up at the very back of the flight by the lavatory. The flight was delayed and the lack of communication was a real concern, A group of Chinese passengers became anxious as they had a connecting flight and sadly the ground staff were rather rude and ignored them. Boarding did not follow the rules at all and was chaotic with a few passengers going back through the barrier to use the lavatory! The ground staff did not seem to care one iota. Incredibly passengers were allowed to take on far too much luggage. Once in Madrid a passenger realised he had left a bag behind at the airport in Seville the cabin crew member did not care less and shrugged her shoulders and pointed the man to the exit."
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified|  Bologna to Madrid. The service of the leaves much to be desired, from the attention at the time of check-in to the punctuality that does not exist. One hour delay on the outward journey and two and a half hours on this return trip, of which an hour and a half were inside the cabin without any attention or explanation. The captain, already with all the people ready to leave, says that we were going to have to wait two hours to get out.ES: El servicio de la aerolíneas deja mucho que desear, desde la atención al momento del check-in a la puntualidad que no existe. Una hora de demora en el viaje de ida y dos horas y media en este viaje de regreso, de las cuales una hora y media fueron dentro de la cabina sin ninguna atención no mayor explicación. El comandante de a bordo, ya con todas las personas listas para partir dice que íbamos a tener que esperar dos horas para salir.. las compañías aéreas tienen todas las concesiones habidas y por haber mientras los clientes somos siempre rehenes."
Air Nostrum,"✅Trip Verified| Flew Air Nostrum from Madrid T4 to Ibiza. Nice short flight on a sunny afternoon. Fast drop-off baggage, a gentle Iberia staff member helped us to print boarding-passes, half-hour late boarding (walked to the plane). Comfortable seats, very kind cabin crew. Flight itself was great, splendid manned by a Lady-captain. So, we started our summer holiday relaxed. One week after, second leg, Ibiza to Valencia, 45 mins. flight on turboprop. Bit cramped seats, bit noisy, but for a such a short time wasn't important. Final approach was rather steep, but landing was OK. Both flight were on time (less than 15 mins. late arrival), uneventful, luggage claimed fast and in good situation, decent priced. I will not hesitate to use Air Nostrum for Spanish domestic flights in the future."
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified|  Horrible. This woman at security decided to make up her own TSA rules and took all of my souvenirs that the locals when purchasing assured me they would make it through security. Tiny hot sauce in plastic 2 Oz bottles. Anything glass that was empty. Cocoa farm souvenirs from green acres. Confiscated. Meanwhile, my multi purpose utility metal chingadera with a serrated edge was ok. Perfume in glass ok. Tiny hot sauce in glass not ok. I’ve traveled over 20 countries without issue with same items. Also tiny school backpack forced to check. Never do I have to check. While some passengers brought 2 to 3 times bigger bags on without checking. This agent ruined my otherwise pleasant experience in bocas. Don’t buy anything over there that’s not made of wood basically. Hate you Air Panama. I’ve included photos of huge bags twice the size of mine allowed on plane. Pat yourself on the back because you lost a return customer and did not make the flight any safer. Might sound petty but just left me with a bad experience that unfortunately overshadowed my good time."
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified|  Ground staff friendly and professional. Limited facilities at Albrook Airport but functional. Couldn't do online check in but was smooth at the airport. Older plane but was on time and smooth flight. No real on board service so take your own snack or drink after airport security. Flight was only 50mins so not a problem. Plane does have a toilet. It's not like flying a major international airline, but its a short flight and was a good experience. They even gave us umbrellas to walk to the plane as it had started to rain which was a nice touch. I'd seen other negative reviews so was pleasantly surprised how professional and polite their staff were. I'd use them again. It's difficult to rate the actual on board service because there really isn't any, no entertainment or food / drinks but it's such a short flight it's not that relevant. So I base my score on the overall experience. Good service and on time flights with friendly staff but in flight service not really offered."
Air Panama,✅Trip Verified| The plane was in a good condition even for an old plane. Both flights were on time. On the 50 minute flight there was no service. Staff of the airline were professional and quick at check in. No e-check in.
Air Panama,"Not Verified|  The worst airline I have ever been in my life and I travel 2-3 times a year on international airlines. This airline has excessive prices since it does not have much competition, internal flights in Panama have a similar cost to an international flight to the United States. Also their prices are excessive, they have a no reimbursement policy and if you get sick with COVID or some other disease and you cannot travel, they will not reimburse you a penny. I would never recommend such an airline."
Air Panama,✅Trip Verified|  Panama City to Bocas Del Toro. Arrived at the airport an hour before my flight to find out I was switched to a different flight two hours after my scheduled flight. They told me I was informed by email which was a lie. The Air Panama staff acted annoyed and placed me on an imaginary waitlist by literally writing me last name down on a blank piece of paper and told me to keep checking and of course there was no room on any earlier flight every time I checked. I recommend using Copa or really any other airline if possible. I am finally boarding my plane after three hours and I will update if more things go wrong!
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified|  Panama City to Bocas del Torro. After reading reviews i was not looking forward to flying Air Panama. But the experience i had with them on the day of the flight was nothing as to what has been written. Check-in was fast, there is no online checking available as far as i could find. The plane was an old Fokker 50. Boarding was fast, we had to walk from the terminal to the plane. Once in the plane you could see the age (and there was a nasty smell onboard). We departed 15 minutes early. The seats were comfortable and plenty of legspace. It was a 40 minute flight, a drink and snack were served by 2 friendly flight attendants. Air Panama get the job done and I didn't have horrible service described by other people. It was fast and efficient nothing more and nothing less, maybe an upgrade in their fleet could do magic for them.y."
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified| 
Albrook (Panama City) to Bocas del Toro. After reading comments about this airline I was a bit worried but our flight with Air Panama was really okay. Checkin at the airport was quick, there were no lines. My bag was 17 kg so I had to pay 9 dollars for the 3 kg overweight. Totally fine. There are no infoscreens at the small airport of Albrook but as there are only leaving a couple of flights a day its obvious when boarding starts. The flight left at 2.30, so right on time. The fokker 50 used for this flight is old but seatpitch was okay for this 55 minute flight to Bocas. After a loud and bumpy take off the crew handed out some crisps and a soda. After 35 minutes of cruising with some wonderful views at the rainforest and Caribbean beaches, the pilot started decent into Bocas airport. After a soft landing and a short taxi to the small apron our luggage appeared within minutes. We really enjoyed this flight in this old air Panama fokker-airplane."
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified|  Panama City to David. This airline is terrible. They made my 5lbs Yorkie go in the luggage area. They wanted me to buy one of their containers. At security they took my tweeter and very small scissors. Mind you, I traveled with my pet in cabin and these 2 items from USA to Costa Rica and Costa Rica to Panama, but in a domestic flight from Albrook to David it wasn’t allowed."
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified|  Panama City to David. Pleasant flight experience on an old Fokker 100. A little expensive for what you get, but there's little competition in Panama. Seats were comfortable & spacious, though the interior of the plane had not seen an update since the late 1980s or early 1990s. Cabin crew were friendly and served soft drinks (including diet options) and plantain chips. Flight departed and arrived about 20min late."
Air Panama,"✅Trip Verified|  Panama City to Bocas del Toro. This is back to the 70s. Absolutely the worst airline I ever flew. We came to the airport and they told us the flight is moved to 5 pm and the return is cancelled too and we can only take the next one at 10am. It meant we will never reach our flight to Colòmbia as it was 2hrs later. No one to talk to,. After screaming we got a letter saying that they deleted 2 flights and because of that we are stuck. Sadly Copa Air didn't care about the letter and we had to pay a penalty. We will pursue with them when we are back home. But if I gave them, their check-in, their fleet and their attitude a score it would be absolute zero."
Air Pegasus,"✅Trip Verified| Overall the airline offered a clean cabin, efficient crew (almost friendly), good seat spacing and on-time service. Pretty good for a budget airline."
Air Pegasus,✅Verified Review| Air Pegasus cancelled my flight two times and I was forced to change my travel date at last minute. I booked flight OP103 BLR-TRV departing 18:30. Few weeks before the departure date they informed me that they are cancelling the flight due to operational reasons. So they modified my booking and provided seats in OP101 BLR-TRV departing at 06:30. The evening before the departure they cancelled OP101 stating operational reasons. I called their customer care number. I could not speak to anyone until 21:30. When I asked them for alternate arrangement they said they dont have any flights and asked me to reschedule my trip for 1 day later. They refused to provide a seat in other airlines. Only option they gave were to cancel the booking or to fly at the later date. The last minute fares were so high that I could not afford to cancel and book on another airline. So I was forced to change my travel date. This is a very common practice of Air Pegasus. There are many issues related to last minute cancellation reported by passengers. Beware of Air Pegasus. Anytime they can cancel the flights stating operational reasons.
Air Pegasus,"✅Verified Review|  Chennai to Madurai with Air Pegasus. Worst customer service and experience. The flight was canceled at last minute after reaching airport in the name of technical failure. When enquirying about some back up plan and penalty, I experienced the worst customer service."
Air Pegasus,"Amazing team at Hubli airport. We had to change the plane in Bangalore to get to Kochi and we might be late, however the team assured us that our baggage will go first from plane, when we have landed. Us and few other people in similar situation were brought by small bus faster than other customer to the airport and one guy from airport in Bangalore from Air Pegasus made sure and check our flights details that we will be on time. Thank you one more time especially for team in Hubli! Amazing customer service."
Air Premia,"Not Verified| This is a good airline with more legroom than most for economy and I have taken it a few times already this year, but I am considering switching to United from now on. The inflight entertainment is sparse. And even the little that they have is almost useless to non-Koreans because they do not have subtitles. Somewhat related to above, United now has Starlink, giving me not only entertainment options from my laptop but the ability for me to be online. I like the extra legroom of Air Premia, but fast and free unlimited internet service is very compelling."
Air Premia,"✅Trip Verified|  The flight attendants are top notch - service is gracious and consistent. Little things like coming by often to take trash, asking your preferences clearly, and sincere friendliness that I think is sadly lacking in some airlines these days. I don't know how they manage to do it but the eggs are truly good. Also, this is the only airline in which I was served a dish I tried to recreate once I got home - a corn salad with red onions and feta. Delicious. They do not serve typical Korean food but all I ask of airline food in economy is that the food not be disgusting. Air Premia's dishes can actually be described as good. The legroom in economy is by far the biggest selling point of this airline.  Even though their entertainment options are severely limited, I am completely happy with economy on Air Premia."
Air Premia,✅Trip Verified|  I have been to Asia 37 times and found Air Premia by accident. They really do not market in the United States. This airline could easily be a leader in the industry but for paying attention to the basics. Serve a decent meal on a long haul flight. The food was simplest the worse I have ever eaten on an airline. Offer more than a dozen movies and tv shows only in one language with subtitles is boring. Why fly a Boeing 787-9 aircraft with all the modern features to service the public and then not use them. But there are far more positives to be considered. The premium economy was like flying business. Plenty of room to relax while crossing the Pacific. The staff was young and energetic. They hustled to make sure everyone for top notch attention despite being forced to serve dog food. The entire crew was also very safety aware. Whomever is in charge of this airline needs to be fired and replaced by an expert that understands inflight service.
Air Rarotonga,"Not Verified|  Excellent 45 minute flight within the Cook Islands. On time, excellent information from flightdeck. One solitary hostess who was friendly and provided tea, coffee and water. Other drinks could be bought. Everything was very pleasant and efficient."
Air Rarotonga,"Not Verified|  Rarotonga to Aitutaki. The flight with Air Rarotonga was a pleasurable experience: spotless clean aircraft with much space for legs, an excellent and friendly service, coffee was served on that short flight on the small plane and even the small airline's brochure and a daily newspaper was offered to read by passengers. I was impressed by the overall quality of the service."
Air Rarotonga,"✅Trip Verified|  My partner and I recently flew from Rarotonga to Aitutaki. The flights are 40 minutes each direction. Well, what a professional airline. A full service was conducted with complimentary tea/coffee/water. Buy on board items offered. Cookies were $2.00 and value for money. The only flight attendant was professional and courteous. the aircraft was immaculate. Seat space rivals some international airline's premium economy offerings. These flights were very pleasant. This airline is a great ambassador for this idyllic part of the world."
Air Senegal,"✅Trip Verified|  Senegal Airlines first delayed flight 213 for five hours then said they could not take me although I had a confirmed business class ticket. I gave a reason of them having to change to a smaller plane because they could not refuel in Banjul, Gambia. They sent me and nine other passengers to the Azalai Hotel in Dakar, which was about an hour from the airport, but when we arrived at the hotel they had no reservation for any of us. The hotel required that I pay out of pocket for the room which cost 130,000 CAF (214.00 USD). Although the airline paid for the taxi to take us to the hotel. I had to pay for a taxi back to the airport. That cost 35,000 CAF (57.86 USD). I am claiming for the two costs or a total of 271.86 USD. I have been told I can be put on a flight at 5 pm tomorrow, 6 July 2024. In addition on the flight from Paris there was no wifi or on-board entertainment or working video screens and the business class seats did not full recline."
Air Senegal,"Not Verified| After having lived in Africa for more than seven years (Mozambique) in addition to now frequently traveling for work I thought I had seen everything. In terms of poor management, traveling with Air Senegal was surprisingly bad. No communication or information, clueless staff and no compensation or willingness to assist passengers (elderly, young, families etc.). My flight from Dakar to Praia was 5hrs late, which was more than the average delay on their flights (3.5hrs). The aircraft supposed to take us to Praia departed for Conakry at the same time as we were supposed to take-off. After speaking with ground staff it became clear that it’s a management strategy/policy - they simply plan more flights (thus, sell more tickets) than their fleet is capable of handling. The operation side of the company have their hands tied as they dont have enough aircrafts or staff to operate according to the route network and timetable, which is reflected on their constant delays."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|   This was one of the worst flights of my life. This flight was operated by GetJet Airlines, which is possibly the worst charter airline in the world! When we got in to the plane, the smell of vomit was in the air. The whole aircraft was dirty, like it was never cleaned before! The seat belts had some weird stains, which I guess were from the vomit. The seats were worse than Air Serbia’s product and the sandwich they gave me was very bland and dry! The crew were good, friendly and spoke good English. Overall, worst flight of my life!"
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|   The food was ok and the crew were very nice. The drinks were good and the seat reclines into a full-flat bed. There are blankets and pillows provided. You also get an amenity kit. The lavatories were ok, nothing special. There is no WiFi onboard. Food could’ve been better."
Air Serbia,✅Trip Verified|   The plane was modern and the cabin very clean and appealing. The crew was very friendly and professional. Fast check in and at Belgrade Airport the suitcases arrived very fast.
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified| I tried a few times to buy ticket from Belgrade to Tivat and vice versa using Air Serbia online. Not one time I succeeded. After lengthy filling of details, passport numbers and what not I would be sent to a payment page. Then filling all the credit card details and then long wait without result. Just info do not close your page. After 5, 10, 15 minutes nothing. Then I have to make an expensive call to Air Serbia to get info that they are aware that I tried to bye tickets. No info why it failed or how to fix it, Then I had to buy a much more expensive ticket from the phone operator, give them all the credit card details and what not. Only then it works. Unfortunately the airline has practical monopoly on flights from Belgrade to Tivat and it is difficult to avoid. Very poor experience."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|   Air Serbia has proven to be the worst airline I've ever experienced, consistently displaying incompetence and unprofessionalism. It started with a delay — understandable, but then it disappeared, only to reappear, leaving me scrambling to update my pick-up service six times. Onboard, I was given a sandwich after confirming I’m vegetarian, only to discover it contained meat. When I raised this issue, one flight attendant laughed, and another dismissed it, showing a shocking lack of care. On another flight, there was a 30-minute delay, with passengers stuck in a 33-degree cabin before being shuffled back and forth without clear communication. No food, water, or proper updates were provided. The constant uncertainty left me unsure if my pick-up service could even accommodate me. Avoid Air Serbia if you value your time and sanity."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|   Unfortunately I fly very often with Air Serbia as they are the only company having most of direct flights from Serbia. Flight was cancelled after 7 hours of waiting, no refund, neither for flight nor for other expenses like taxi, food and parking ticket. Very often long delays. Once I had to miss my ongoing flight and I did not have right to use return flight so I had to pay that day for the new ticket. I had admission to hospital and they did not want to refund me the ticket.  Very unprofessional and unkind customer service staff in Belgrade, I needed help few times and never got it. No flexibility, with light ticket you have no rights at all and usual price is between 200-600€ for European return flights. Very expensive for the service they provide."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|  I was flying from Paris to Budapest and by technical reasons the second flight from Belgrade to Budapest was cancelled. I had to readjust my trip with my friends (they were waiting for the in Hungary). That led to additional expenses. I asked Air Serbia for a refund of 400 euros (I've spend around 325€ because of this inconvenience) and they just gave it to me without much trouble and in short terms. I understand that technical problems can occur, but the question was how you solve them. I was satisfied with the solution which made my trip pleasant, despite the flight cancellation."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|  I recently had a deeply frustrating and stressful experience with Air Serbia that I feel compelled to share. On April 11, I bought a direct flight ticket from Belgrade to Saint Petersburg for my mother-in-law. I specifically chose a direct flight, despite the higher cost, to avoid the inconvenience of connections. Additionally, I paid for a reserved window seat. We checked in 24 hours before the flight, thinking everything was in order. However, when my mother-in-law arrived at the gate, she was told that the flight was overbooked, and she would only be able to fly if someone else didn’t show up. After two hours of waiting, they confirmed she wouldn't be flying. This left her stranded in the sterile zone of the airport, completely unsure of what to do or where to go. It was 1 a.m., the airport was nearly empty, and no staff were available to assist her. Fortunately, another woman in the same situation helped her navigate back through border control to the terminal. I met her there, and we went to the Air Serbia representative. They offered her a flight 24 hours later with a 2-hour connection in Istanbul. Considering her age and slow mobility, this was an impractical solution. After much insistence, they finally offered a flight to Moscow the next day. This meant finding our own way from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, but it was a more feasible option. To add insult to injury, we received no compensation for this entire ordeal, not even for the reserved window seat that I had paid for. This entire experience caused immense stress and frustration for my mother-in-law and me. The lack of communication, poor service, and inadequate handling of the situation by Air Serbia were appalling. I will avoid flying with Air Serbia in the future and would not recommend them to anyone. This was an absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional experience."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|  Worst flying experience ever. 40 min flight was over two hours late. No apology or explanation offered, no staff at airport to advise. Missed onward connection and stranded in Belgrade for the night. The staff there were rude, uncaring, disorganised and aggressive. Couldn’t quite believe how awful it all was. Will never fly with them again. If I could give zero stars, I would."
Air Serbia,"✅Trip Verified|  It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They canceled my flight without re-booking and sent a useless e-mail saying, ""We are sorry."" There are no refund, new booking options, or online options to resolve. The US contact number was just disabled, e-mail with my request was never replied (more than 3 weeks passed). It took several days calling to different countries contact centers to reach out to them. They ended up re-booking an earlier flight, which was operated by Turkish. Online check-in doesn't check in with Serbian, because they kicked my booking to Turkish. It doesn't work with Turkish either because it's not their reservation. Avoid, avoid, avoid. They don't resolve customers' issues."
Air Seychelles,"✅Trip Verified|  On collecting my baggage from a return flight from Mahe to Johannesburg, I discovered that the handle of my suitcase was ripped off. I immediately reported it at Air Seychelles at baggage collection, and was told that someone would be in contact to assit with either repairing the damage or replacing my suitcase. To cut a long story short, had to contact them multiple times as the first report was lost, then had a couple of more rounds with contacting people, eventually had to send photos of the suitcase (twice), to be told at the end of the saga that the damage is minor and I should claim from my travel insurance. I queried this again and no reply. Will be the last time I use this airline and others please be beware that Air Seychelles take no responsibilty of your property while in their care."
Air Seychelles,"✅Trip Verified|  Everything about the flight was fine, except for the food. The salad was undercooked lentils, which was inedible. The main course choice was chicken, fish or pasta and they were all awful. The desert was a stodgy yellow piece of cake. If Sky Chefs are the food suppliers, they really did a bad job of these meals."
Air Seychelles,"✅Trip Verified|  Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Mauritius (had to take this as this would be the only direct option with a high price of $300+), and this became my worst flight experience in my life as my original departure time of Apr. 19, 10:00 eventually became Apr. 20, 15:10. A transactional email arrives the night before the flight that the flight will be delayed but new flight time will be released later on, shattering my sleep already as I am in fear that my travel plans will be disrupted (and it did in a serious manner). Had to be at the airport on time nonetheless (as I now know that Air Seychelles will never care about my travel plans and therefore I will have to be at the airport to be at the scene myself) and another email arrives that 13:20 would be the new departure time. But then nothing happens and nobody at the check-in counter knows what is going on except that there is a ""discussion"" about the flight's fate if it would fly out on 13:20 as planned or not (and it did not). Finally, at around 11:00 an Air Seychelles temporary employee approaches the passengers that the flight is ""decided"" to be delayed (a quick check on its two A320 Neos reveal that they are flying other routes instead, but no explanations were given at all so how would I know what is happening at all) and that all passengers will have to stay where Air Seychelles sends them to. All passengers end up taking the bus provided by Air Seychelles (after loading their luggage on an open truck's cargo hold) and are all bussed to a terrible resort about 30 minutes away from the airport. Then rooms were assigned arbitrarily (couples were okay but solo travelers were randomly assigned rooms together) and a terrible lunch buffet with only one free non-alcoholic beverage was offered (not even a meal voucher as that would be so much more expensive to the airline). Then we were told by Air Seychelles that the flight could depart any time that day or the day after and that the passengers should wait for the call in their hotel rooms (that is, someone should be in the hotel room instead of being at the beach in front of the resort) as well as frequently consult Air Seychelles Facebook page for updates. Then the hotel calls that passengers should gather by 11:00 the next morning without even telling us what the new departure time would be (had to check myself via the aforementioned Facebook page that the new departure time had been announced as Apr. 20, 15:10). Then the next morning, once again the weird bussing back from the hotel to the airport, and then found out that an Ethiopian B737-MAX8 was there to run the route instead. Checked-in and finally departed at around 15:40, landing in Mauritius at around 18:00 (a whopping ~30 hour delay). Cannot say much about the aircraft and in-flight service as it was provided by Ethiopian Airlines, but it was pretty basic with basic seats without any IFE and a tiny sandwich given during the flight (alcoholic beverages were available though). At the end of the day, my Mauritius travel plans were disrupted without any reimbursement of any kind from the airline for the losses. I heard before that Air Seychelles had financial troubles in the past and now I think understand why. Will never fly again with Air Seychelles, and even give up Seychelles as my vacation destination if Air Seychelles is unavoidable."
Air Seychelles,"Not Verified|  We were travelling back to Johannesburg after a vacation in the Maldives when my husband suddenly lost consciousness after about 90 minutes in the air. The cabin crew were outstanding. They found a Doctor on the flight, brought the oxygen, helped administer the oxygen, calmed the family down and were caring and kind for 2 hours. When we landed in the Seychelles, an ambulance was on the runway and the excellent Sara Chang Pen, Guest Service Agent for Air Seychelles, took over. She accompanied us to the hospital and negotiated our admission and treatment there, staying with us for several hours until he was well enough to be discharged. She also booked us into a hotel, organized our passports to be stamped, sent our luggage to the hotel and ensured we were booked on the earliest flight home 3 days later. I do not believe that we could have had better service on any other airline and we are truly grateful for their excellent service."
Air Seychelles,✅Trip Verified| They keep on cancelling the flights. I had to reschedule my itinerary twice before finally cancelling my flight for third time. Avoid.
Air Seychelles,"Not Verified| Praslin to Mahe. Over zealous security screening at Praslin when they noticed we had packed a small pack of batteries in our hold baggage. Had to take out every item of clothing until they were found and no time to repack. On check in we thought we had prepaid for excess baggage via our travel agent only to be told it had not gone through. Staff could see that we had completed the process but still charged us the airport price rather than the online price. Staff completely unhelpful and appeared to take great pleasure in making things as difficult as possible. Would not give us any assistance of any contact details. Currently taking up the issue with their customer services and the office of their CEO. Flight cramped and noisy, recommend ear plugs, and very warm. Plus side, it was shorter than most bus journey I normally take. No assistance offered by ground crew getting on or off the plane with flimsy hand rail and low doorway."
Air Seychelles,"✅Trip Verified|  We were booked on a one-way flight from Praslin to Mauritius (PRI-SEZ-MRU). The checkin in Praslin was pretty smooth. The lady told us that our baggage is directed to Mauritius, nothing to worry about on Mahé. Great news! After arrival we had to checkin again as the second flight was international. At the counter I mentioned casually that we only have two backpacks as carry on as our checked baggage is transferred to Mauritius. ""No that is not possible"" we were told. ""You have to pick it up at the baggage claim and check it in again."" After some discussions I went back. Luckily a met a couple from the UK that did the same trip as we did. Same problem there. We found an Air Seychelles employee, explained the situation, gave her our baggage tags we got earlier at Praslin and followed her back to the counter. They were having an argue. Unbelievable. Both flights operated by one airline that does not know their internal procedures and processes. After we were told that the baggage is transferred to Mauritius - surprise - the real problems began as my girlfriend was traveling with her wheelchair that comes with electrically powered wheels. We showed them the necessary IATA certificates and technical specs as we always do in that situation around the globe with many airlines. Airlines are generally not pleased to transport batteries in the cargo area due to potential risk of fire. But in this case the batteries are an integrated part of the wheels. You cannot take them off without taking off both wheels completely. So as usual they checked everything and let us finally continue. So far so good. After boarding was finished the captain announced that we were actually early some minutes.  But suddenly the lady from the check-in appeared at our seats to tell us that the wheelchair will not be transported by Air Seychelles because an approval was missing. We had no idea what she meant. As I already wrote we had shown them the papers. And by the way we had sent the all the documents five days ahead of the flight as requested by Air Seychelles. We never got a reply to that email. They still insisted an approval was missing. Just to mention again: No issues with the same airline on the first flight segment before... However three to four employees were discussing at the aircraft door. After 30 minutes the captain explained the situation to all passengers via speaker. He said they are organizing the missing approval and are waiting for it. What missing approval and how are they organizing it by themselves when the complained that we did not bring the approval. Simply does not make sense at all. After an hour I accidentally could observe a guy walking right next to the aircraft carrying the wheelchair's wheels with the batteries. Minutes later we took off without further information. After arrival in Mauritius we found the wheelchair in parts lying on the floor in front of the special baggage counter. Some idiots bent one of the shafts that connect the wheels to the chassis. Without any tools and with pure force I could barely fix the shaft. Otherwise our trip had ended at this point. We have never ever experienced that kind of discrimination against people with disabilities anywhere on the globe. Totally unprofessional and completely intolerable. The Seychelles are probably the most beautiful places we have ever seen on earth but Air Seychelles is a catastrophe. Shame on you!"
Air Seychelles,✅Trip Verified|  Our flight was booked to fly in December 21st but Seychelles was closed to visitors from South Africa due to COVID. We never flew. Since then I have been asking for either a refund or travel voucher as we are expecting to re-book for December 22. But after several emails and requests Air Seychelles do not respond. What is one supposed to do to get what we paid for?
Air Seychelles,"✅Trip Verified|  I had booked flight back from Praslin airport where we had our hotel Lemuria back to Mahe for our international flight. So we booked flight at 5th of may directly in the airport, becouse it was near our hotel. So my trip back to Mahe was like scary movie, and all of a service for the Air Seychelles was awfull. First of all - our flight was booked for 9th may - thats sunday, this is a day off at the airport - so nobody will take phone, nobody will answer you on email, and only service for flight who dont know anything will work at the airport. Be very careful to use their flights on Sundays. In the morning 9th of may at the day of our departure we noticed that a storm comes to an islands, but we saw flights still are going, and nobody told us that something will be wrong (we had flight at 18 -40), so we packed everything and were preparing to leave. Thanks to Lemuria hotel crew at 12 o clock we were told that the airport is closed and there will be no flights today, they also sent their man to have duty in the airport if something else happened, and he called every 30 minutes. Air Seychelles didn't even get in touch with us in that day, didn't answer the phones etc. The ferry that goes only 2 times a day was already sold completely for that day. So we and other passengers had to book boats not to miss their international flights. When we arrived to the airport for our flight, planes from Air Seychelles still were not flying, and we get back home. After we get home I sent email and all information air Seychelles manager asked us for ticket refund, and we get only about 30% of money for our tickets, because we were charged for ""no show"" at non working airport, and refund charge. That's a total disgrace.  If you use them you should have some additional money for private boats. Be ready for ""no calls, no service"" at critical situations, cause you may get to the airport and it would be closed in case of weather and other transport (ferry, boats) will be unavailable at the time you noticed it."
Air Seychelles,"✅Trip Verified|  Seychelles to Johannesburg. Below average service from in flight attendants. Appalling attitude, inability to carry out basic duties. Do not respond when they are buzzed, and expect you to walk to the back of the aircraft to get what you need eg a glass of water. This is a problem as the lavatory is also at the back, so at any given time theres a queue of passengers trying to navigate through the narrow aisle at the back of the aircraft. Furthermore, they are absolutely not child friendly, and made the flight very unpleasant for me and my family."
Air Tahiti Nui,"Not Verified| Excellent airline. Flights outbound and return were on time, if not early. Service and staff were helpful and friendly and the plane was very comfortable. Definitely recommend them. The only negatives: the film choice was not great for an English speaker, and there was, if anything, too much food served!"
Air Tahiti Nui,"✅Trip Verified|   Absolutely disgraceful operation. All our booking confirmations stated 1 bag max 32kg luggage FREE. Manager in LAX was one of the rudest airline employees we've dealt with. Despite it being in black and white on our contractual booking receipt she wouldn't let us travel unless we paid $120 excess luggage. We pre-ordered special meals (AVML). On the return sector, we were handed regular meals. We asked if our special meals had been loaded. Crew member scoffed. 'What kind of special food?' 'The AVMLs we ordered'. 'We don't have any'. He handed me a pizza. I asked if it was vegetarian. 'Yes, it's cheese' I inspected the pizza. It had pork ham on it. When I showed him he took it, walked off and continued the service. Had I not asked for his solution I would not have had any food at all. Unforgivable to insist food is vegetarian when it's not. What about Muslims and food allergies too? His attitude was disgraceful. Never again."
Air Tahiti Nui,✅Trip Verified|   Worst airline ever. Flight cancelled same morning due to “maintenance”. Rebooked to 2 days later. No hotels in Tahiti available. They told people to get airbnbs. No compensation.
Air Tahiti Nui,"✅Trip Verified|  Got a flight delay because of ""technical reason"" but there was no problem and the staff told it was actually because it was too late (5pm). So the flight got postponed by 1 day making me loose the money of the hotel I booked for that night (non refundable) and shorten my time on Tikehau island. The only ""compensation"" they provided was a snack and a drink. Ridiculous! I asked them for a refund of the night i spent for nothing because of them the following day (14/10/2023) and only got a reply 06/06/2024 so 8 months later to told me they wouldn't do anything. Worst customer service ever from an airline company. Such a shame there is no other company locally providing more flight to these small islands to dethrone them."
Air Tahiti Nui,"Not Verified|   We were a family of 7 people, ranging from 7 year old to 80 year old with walking difficulties. It was a midnight flight out of LAX to PPT. The food delivery truck hit the side of our plane. But the gate agents lied to us and kept saying it was ""paperwork"", and ""security"" issues. We all knew that they lied because they didn't want to call it ""mechanical"" issue because they would be liable for the passengers somehow. Then finally around 2 am, they told us the flight was ""delayed"" until that morning at 10 am, and told us to go to ticketing, where they will help us with hotels and transportation. When we got to the ticketing counter, they did not help us at all. They did not offer us any hotel rooms, or transportation help. We were on our own. They offered NO help at all. And we were the 4th party at the counter. Before we left the counter that night / morning, I repeatedly asked the agent if we will have the same assigned seats? Because we had children and elderly passengers. They repeatedly promised me yes, we have the exact same seats. Next morning came. We came back, along with hundreds of passengers. When we got to the counter, the agent scattered the 7 of us all around the plane separately. How incredible is that. We were connecting to Bora Bora, which we already missed due to the flight delay. So I asked the agent about that. She said we will have guaranteed seats the next morning. Don't worry. Well, we didn't. We spent an entire day the next morning in PPT waiting for standby, and we had to fly separately to Bora Bora again. And one more lie. We had no accommodations when we get to PPT, because our final destination was Bora Bora, and by the time we land in PPT, there were no more flights to Bora Bora. So we will need to stay overnight in PPT. The agent told us that there will be someone in their domestic office in Tahiti to help us find lodging. Well, that was a lie too. When we got there, their domestic flight office had closed and no one was there to help us. So we were there again to fend for ourselves. Anyways, I filed a complaint for all the extra costs incurred during the debacle, and the missed hotel stay in Bora Bora. I have been working with one of their agents for almost a year now, via email. He is as unhelpful as anyone can be. I don't feel the customer service attitude. He repeatedly ignores me, drags his feet, as evidenced by it being almost a year!! They have no phone number available to chat with. I have no way of escalating my case. I asked him to talk to his supervisor. Nothing. He just ignores me. I called the only phone number there is for ATN - reservations. I called them and asked to speak to their supervisor, thinking that they might know the supervisor of customer service. I have not heard back from them. Every time I call the number, their supervisor has been at a meeting, and they always tell me the manager would call me back. They never have. Do yourself a favor and ask yourself: Would you go with an airline that doesn't even give you access to proper customer service.? ""Technically"" they have customer service, via email. There is no one to talk to. Just think about that. I have no recourse. I have no way of escalating, and I can't find anyone that is willing to help me. No one cares. Things like this sound crazy whenever I come across them. They sound like it comes from a negative person who likes to complaint or make up stories,  until it happened to me."
Air Tahiti Nui,"✅Trip Verified| The crew were great, friendly, and professional. Food was okay for airline food. The seat in business is the issue. I'm not tall at 5' 10"" (1.7m) and I found it difficult to lie comfortably because of the very narrow foot space on the Rockwell Collins Diamond flatbed seats. In every other respect, this seat was very comfortable and the blanket provided is one of the best I've ever seen. In fairness, on the return journey, I did get some solid sleep for about six hours, but hardly surprising as the plane was due to take off at 23:59 and was delayed until 00:30. The IFE is pretty limited, so glad I had a book. As this airline has a virtual monopoly on this route the ticket price is very high."
Air Tahiti Nui,"Not Verified|  Absolutely waste of money. We flew from Auckland to Los Angeles, and the experience was awful. Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. The service in the cabin was very average, and the airport staff were rude, unprofessional, and aggressive. I personally trusted Air New Zealand as I bought the ticket from them, and it am wonder how Air New Zealand partnered with such a low quality air line."
Air Tahiti Nui,"Not Verified|  Shockingly bad service from this airline. The flight was originally going to land at 7 am and I took this into account when making other travel reservations. Then, about a day before the flight, they told us it was cancelled, and they put us on a different flight that would arrive 14 hours later, around 9 pm. Upon calling them, Air Tahiti Nui offered zero compensation and said that even if I filed a claim, nothing would likely happen. I had to rebook my following connections out of my pocket."
Air Tahiti Nui,"✅Trip Verified|  This review is difficult to write since I was never able to actually fly with Air Tahiti Nui. The company recently had a workers strike that caused them to cancel multiple flights. The issue here isn’t the strike, it is how ATN handled it. Their response to the situation was terrible, with not only a lack of communication to affected passengers, but purposeful misinformation when you spoke to their representatives. My wife and I talked about taking this trip 10 years ago when we got married. We saved our money, spent the last 7 months planning, and then flew to LAX the day before our flight to PPT via ATN. Less than 23 hours before take-off, they cancelled the flight. They provided nothing more than general statements saying they were in the process of rebooking. Then nothing but silence. My wife called their representatives later in the day and were told that we would have a flight out THAT DAY and would be contacting us. Then more silence, nothing. Again called in and were offered a flight 4 days from now, cutting our trip on half. Absolutely unacceptable. We ended up not getting rebooked, not receiving any direct communication from ATN, and had to cancel our trip. If they had been more prepared for this contingency, as most competent enterprises are, they would have had plans in place in why to do when this happens. Instead, we lost our chance to go to Bora Bora. This experience was not unique with many other passengers having to cancel their trips due to Air Tahiti Nui's utter lack of planning and communication. My recommendation is to stay clear of Air Tahiti Nui. They may not be a problem for your trip, but their incompetence is readily apparent. If things go sideways, I don’t trust them to know what they’re doing."
Air Tahiti Nui,"Not Verified|  Air Tahiti Nui is absolutely horrible! My husband and I bought tickets from Air Tahiti Nui to go to Tahiti for our honeymoon. We had a connecting flight with another airline. My husband and I paid an additional $60 through Air Tahiti Nui so we could sit together on a 8 hour international flight. Due to a flight time change, our ticket numbers changed. Air Tahiti Nui’s system did not sync with the other airlines system. Therefore, Air Tahiti Nui lost our reservation and sold our seats that we paid for! Then, Air Tahiti Nui blamed us for changing our ticket numbers. I’m not sure how that is even possible to do on our end! After going back and fourth with Air Tahiti Nui for 2 hours at the airport, they found 2 spots for us on the flight. However, the seats were not together despite the fact we paid an additional $60 to sit together. Absolutely ridiculous! No wonder their reviews are so low."
Air Tanzania,"✅Trip Verified|   Do not go anywhere near this train wreck of an airline. That have some very suspect business practices. Tanzania has some incredible sights and most people are very friendly and trustworthy. What they don’t have is a trustworthy or competent national airline. I booked a business class ticket ESky. Because it’s a short flight from JRO-ZNZ it was only about $100 more. When I arrived at the airport I was told the original plane was damaged and a replacement was being flown in and they had given my business class seat to someone else. Not wanting to argue I asked them to simply refund the difference between the business class seat I had paid for and the economy seat I received. The answer from the very rude ground attendant was incredible, she said “we can’t afford that”. Then I said just give me a business class ticket on the return flight instead. The manager arrived late and looking like he had just crawled out of bed and was just as rude as the first woman. Flight was very late but non-eventful, cabin crew were nothing special, plane looked pretty worn out, landing was rough. I followed up with Air Tanzania but they don’t know how to answer a phone, can’t read emails or don’t speak English. I also contacted ESky, the ticket agency I used but will never use again, and they have been useless so far. Locals in Tanzania told me to avoid Air Tanzania and use Precision Air instead as an alternative. If you’ve booked a safari trip with an agent I would check to see if they’ve got you on Air Tanzania and simply change it to Precision Air."
Air Tanzania,"✅Trip Verified|   I had an incredibly frustrating experience with Air Tanzania. My flight was originally scheduled for 20:20, but I received an email notifying me that it was delayed to 20:50. Shortly after, I received a second email pushing the departure time to 01:20 the next day. I ended up waiting at the airport for over 7 hours with no hotel room or proper accommodations provided. The airline staff were extremely rude, showing no empathy or concern for the passengers who were stuck waiting. We were placed in a lounge with very limited seating, forcing many passengers to stand for hours. Overall, the lack of communication, poor customer service, and complete disregard for passenger comfort made this an awful experience. I would strongly recommend avoiding Air Tanzania."
Air Tanzania,"✅Trip Verified|  So far this has been my worst experience at an airport. I booked this flight 7 weeks in advance and they rescheduled my 1650 flight to 0655 on the same day. As a frequent flyer, I’ve had my flight rescheduled before and I it always makes me a little upset but normally they’ll reschedule my flight to a later time. Air Tanzania rescheduled my flight almost 10 hours before but at least they had the common courtesy of letting me know (via email) that my 1650 flight got moved to 0655 at 0450, literally less than two hours before my flight was supposed to leave and I was staying an hour away from the airport."
Air Tanzania,✅Trip Verified|  I checked my bag in with this airline and they tore up my suitcase. Once I received my suitcase from baggage claim I instantly go to their office to file a claim nobody was there. The door was closed and locked with a paper on the door with a contact number and email. I send a email and text message via WhatsApp. I never hear anything back so I followed up some days later. They finally texted me back and ask me did I file a report with lost and found the day arrival. How would somebody know their protocol to file a claim with lost and found the day of. And they tell me we know you don’t know our protocol but we can’t do anything if you didn’t file a report with lost and found the day of. Like what kind of mess is that on top of you all not even texting the same day back which if you all responded the day of I could have done that while I was still there during my lay over. They fact that you all never responded till I texted them again saying how unprofessional they were for never writing me back. I would never suggest this unprofessional flight company. Would not recommend!
Air Tanzania,✅Trip Verified|  Not a reliable flight. Delayed by two hours and the counter staff keep on saying “wait”. They also don’t know it’s delayed for how many hours. I missed my connection flight from Mumbai and I have to take a taxi to my destination which is 6 to 7 hours to reach home. No support provided.
Air Tanzania,"Not Verified|  Worst airline I have ever come across. I booked my tickets months ago. A few days before my flight I received a cancelation with no replacement. I tried calling and emailing customer service but no answer. I panicked as all my international flights were confirmed. Few days before my flight I got email stating my ticket has been reinstated. I was relieved. Shortly after I received another email stating that my tickets have been canceled again. Then replaced. On the very day I received another email stating my flight has been replaced by an earlier flight. So I rushed to the airport. At the airport we're told that there's a delay of 2 hours, then when the time came there was a delay of 4 hours. That means I would miss my connection. Not to take a chance of missing my connecting flight the agent managed to find me a direct flight to Nairobi on Precision Air. After changing back and forth we're told there was not going to be a flight I was glad to be able to get on Precision air arriving at the same time. Air Tanzania worst airlines. Avoid by all means!"
Air Tanzania,"Not Verified|  On the outward journey from Zanzibar to Kilimanjaro two hours late, now I'm stuck at Kilimanjaro airport and I was supposed to leave half an hour ago but still no one (like last time) is giving any information. I risk missing my connection to return to Italy and there is no staff to ask. Terrible! Nel viaggio di andata da Zanzibar a Kilimangiaro due ore di ritardo, ora sono fermo nell'aeroporto del Kilimangiaro e dovevo partire mezz'ora fa ma ancora nessuno (come l'altra volta) da delle informazioni! Rischio di perdere la coincidenza per tornare in Italia e non c'è personale a cui chiedere! Pessimi!"
Air Tanzania,"Not Verified|  After reading many bad reviews of Air Tanzania I took the risk to fly with Air Tanzania and after all it did not disappoint. The crew was professional and friendly, even as the service on the ground. Even though it was a short flight, there was food served, which was not too bad. The flights were also on time, so the overall experience was quite good. The airline lacks in technology as it has no app (so no digital ticket in Apple Wallet), as well as the website is quite outdated and the online checking-in process is not convenient."
Air Tanzania,Not Verified| 2 times delayed then cancelled. Offer for last flight of the day. Thanks we taking different airline because next day we have to go to Europe. We had also no good feelings if it was save to use this airline. No good western standards. We advise - don't use it.
Air Tanzania,✅Trip Verified|  I seldom take the time to write a review but I feel for the well-being of other travelers I should warn everyone off these amateurs. The filght first leg of the flight was cancelled and rebooked by them except it had the second leg leaving before the first leg arrived. There was terrible communication from the airline. This seemed to be a well known problem by the airport ticket staff who booked me on a direct flight - 6 hours later which brought me to my destination after mid-night. My hosts almost fell asleep during the 90 minute drive to our accomodation. There has been zero response from Air Tanzania for compensation for the delay. Fly Airlink or anyone else in the region. Avoid Air Tanzania at all costs.
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|   Both legs of my flight were much better than expected. The aircraft was clean and fresh. The cabin crew were pleasant and efficient. Check in was a breeze on both legs. Flights departed and arrived as scheduled. The seat was just fine for a 4 hour flight. I am a normal-sized person. I would certainly fly with them again, given the overall experience."
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|   There was a problem with the plane so they decided to put a smaller plane. Fighting now for reimbursement because I was not offered the seat or services that I had paid for which cost a lot of money when paying for two people and they were not willing to work at all. They still wanted to charge me for all my food and drinks, even though that they could not provide me with club class. Will definitely never be flying with air transit again. This was leaving from Toronto to Cayo Coco not only that one talking to the flight attendant to try to get information. They didn’t really want to help me out in anyway, or give me much information.  You also do not get priority boarding like advertised. I totally understand that if there was an issue with the original plane and having to switch is out of their control, but then making the accommodations or making up for it on the return flight is the least they could do."
Air Transat,"Not Verified|   We flew from Toronto to Paris. Flight attendants were very helpful and welcoming. We especially appreciated Emerson’s help. He was great! Ground crew were great, too!"
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|   We know Air Transat specs for carry on baggage are ridiculous compared to industry standards and nothing besides a tiny purse fits in their metal tester but at the same time, most experienced air Transat agents don't make a fuss out of it and understand that people who travel buy regular carry on size luggage not air transat size luggage for their trips. However what we found absolutely appalling is that it is subjective from agent to agent. So on our inbound Transat flight from Canada to Europe, we checked in our carry on free of charge as well as another 7 European flights on smaller planes but we got unlucky sucked into an unexperienced agent in Paris who made us pay 80 euros for a standard carry on luggage! Its a pure roberry. Either apply rules and make everyone pay (80 % of carry on luggages don't fit in the transat mold) but don't leave it in some subjective baffoon hands."
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|   I booked a flight on Air Transat for September 25, 2024. The company decided that it would no longer operate flights on that date. She decided unilaterally to change my flight date to September 27, 2024. And it is impossible for me to take this flight on September 27, 2024. I know my flight is not refundable or anything else. I purchased my ticket through my credit card company. I contacted them and asked to schedule my flight on September 23 (place available and approximately the same price. I will pay the difference). But they don't want to. I'm going to lose my flight and I'm going to lose my money. Why not give me the opportunity to fly on September 23 instead of September 27. Places available.  J'ai réservé un vol sur air transat pour le 25 septembre 2024. La compagnie a décidé quel ne faisait plus de vol à cette date. Elle a décidé unilatéralement de modifié ma date de vol et de mettre le 27 septembre 2024. ""Et il m'est impossible de prendre ce vol le 27 septembre 2024."" Je sais que mon vol n'est ni remboursable ni rien d'autre. J'ai pris mon billet par l'intermédiaire de ma cie de carte de crédit. J'ai les ai contacté et demandé de mettre mon vol le 23 septembre (place dispo et sensiblement le même prix. Je vais payer la différence). Mais bon. Ils ne veulent pas. Je vais perdre mon vol et je vais perdre mon argent. Pourquoi ne pas m'avoir donné la possibilité de voler le 23sept au lieu du 27. Places dispo."
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|   Air Transat is probably the worst airline of them all. Absolute money grab with terrible service all around (except the Pilots - they got us there). Seats are terribly uncomfortable, they added a metal ring under the seat to limit the size of personal bags. Food is terrible and they insist on serving meals at midnight while everyone is trying to sleep. They are even playing commercials during your inboard entertainment. Moreover, they have become the master of hidden fees. First, the check baggage is not longer included as well as the carry on. All extras. Worst of all, the needed measurements to qualify as a carry-on is smaller than the rest of the industry - that way they can force you to pay to check-in your carry-on: Standard: 22 x 16 x 9 inches Air Transat: 20 x 16 x 9 inches (that way, the carry-on bag you bought for that very purpose will have to be checked-in because it doesn't fit in their metal tester (which is probably smaller that the actual measurements. Please note that the overhead bins can accomodate much bigger bags - Again, they lure you in with the cheap price, only to realise it's for the sub-economy class with nothing included. Add 120$ per person per bag - and you can basically only bring a small handbag as a carry on. At least Ryan Air is honest about being a budget airline - Air Transat should drop the pretence that they are good airline."
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified| If you are thinking of flying from Europe to Canada, I would not recommend AirTransat. I flew from Barcelona to Calgary via Toronto. A month before the airline changed the initial connection from Montreal to Calgary. It scheduled my flight to arrive even later to my destination. When I arrived in Toronto, I had a layover of 5 hours and then my connecting flight to Calgary was CANCELLED. Nobody contacted me. Can you imagine the situation after having flown for nine hours and a layover of 5 hours? I spent the night at the airport and in the morning I try to contact the airline, (paying extra money to my phone company), but they were helpless on the phone saying that I had to contact the company which operated for them (PORTER). I filed a complaint for AirTransat without any answer 10 days so far... AFTER THREE DAYS my flight had been cancelled I received a message from Porter rescheduling my flight.... THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUED with my returning flight: I received a modification of my returning flights. Curiously enough, my flight from Calgary to Toronto had disappeared!!! And my flight now from Toronto to Barcelona had been delayed one day later! In the message AirTrans wrote that if I didn't accept this modification, I could ask for a refund filling a form. I try to fill that form and (surprise!) I couldn't! It said that I couldn't filling it because it was less than 24 hours before my leaving! (It's 31 July and the flight is on 6 Aug!!). I can understand that sometimes there are problems with flights, but this time it has been a record: 3 out of 4 have had cancellations and delays. Besides, the most important thing is to receive some kind of support or help from the company you paid for the tickets. Nothing of that I have received from Air Transat. I have had to pay more than $2,000 dollars in advance for their incompetent professionalism. Can you imagine this happening to you flying with children?"
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|  Probably the worst transcontinental flight of our lives. The main reason for this was the seats. They were uncomfortable from the first moment we sat down. No amount of squirming or readjusting could help this. This Airbus was configured with 9 seats across instead of the standard 8. The legroom was good, the backrest acceptable but the seat itself was an abominable thing. The food was also a big disappointment, lacking in taste and quantity. They served drinks but water bottles were $3.99 each. No blankets and no pillows were provided but they sold them. The kicker is that this flight wasn’t cheaper than competitors! The entertainment options were also substandard in our estimation. Many decades old movie favorites and few newer releases. We found the selection to be limited and uninspired. The screen itself was good quality. In the end, our opinion is that Air Transat took every available opportunity to choose profit over comfort. We’ve flown the same route with BA, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air France. They all have pros and cons but they are all much better than our Air Transat experience for roughly the same price. And I must add the cabin crew weren’t that great either."
Air Transat,"✅Trip Verified|  Simply the worst experience I have ever had. I was on time from a code share partner from fll. Porter. They were late but I still had 60 minutes before the flight. I actually had 2:30 hours because Porter later told me the Transat flight was actually delayed. Porter checked my bags through but for some reason could not print the boarding passes. So I had to go to check in just to get them a a two minute walk to the gate. I met the most rude and unpleasant woman on the 28th of June at 11pm. I had a 4 year old and 12 year old traveling with me. She made no effort, I have no idea why even the Porter representative tried to talk to her, this is a woman who is a control freak. Rude and disrespectful unhelpful - her colleagues were scared to say anything initially did try to help but were intimidated by this person with an attitude. I got no help of where to stay how to get my checked bags over two hours later and only because Porter sent someone to get them. It was after 2am when I got to a hotel with my 4 and 12 year old. So I can’t comment on the plane or trip itself."
Air Transat,✅Trip Verified|  Was not given seats I paid $300 extra for. Was charged $84US more than the posted price on their website by agent at hotel. Was lied to by agent at airport who promised excursions were taking CN $ at par with US. Filed 2 claims for reimbursement as instructed. Told wait 30 days. At 30 days told wait 60 days. At 60 days no response.
Air Vanuatu,"Not Verified|  Check in at Port Vila was full of smiles, pleasantries and efficient. Handed two seats of boarding passes, one for access to the Lounge at Port Vila and the other to board the flight. Passed through Security and Immigration swiftly and made our way to the Lounge. The Lounge is a private Lounge operated by a third party, it is Air conditioned and has a fridge with refreshments and some snacks, comfortable seating and a view of the tarmac/runways. Very pleasant to stay in the air conditioned comfort whereas the main terminal waiting area is not air conditioned. Boarding was quick and easy and we settled into our Business Class Seats 2A 2C. Once boarding finished, I switched to the other side 2D as 2C was faulty. Pretake off drinks provided at 7am in the morning, Juice or Water only. After a slightly delayed take off, Breakfast was offered, was hot, tasty and just enough. Coffee or tea provided. We were surprised to find no alcoholic beverages are served in both Economy Class and Business Class. No explanation as to why, they just do not service Alcohol, so no Champagne for the wife.... No Wi-Fi or IFE to pass the time, but the seats did have charging ports. The crew were friendly and again full of smiles, perhaps not as attentive as they could have been but then again if we wanted anything (apart from Alcohol) they were there. Flight arrived on time and overall a good flight and would certainly travel Air Vanuatu again. I see on previous reviews there are some very negative comments on Air Vanuatu.. We've travelled extensively and all we can say to those negative people is pull your head in. Delays and disruptions are part and parcel of travel and you deal with it as it comes. In the end, Air Vanuatu got you there didn't they. We highly recommend Air Vanuatu, we booked on-line in Economy Class then negotiated the Business class differential with Air Vanuatu who were obliging to our surprise. Well Done Air Vanuatu.."
Air Vanuatu,"Not Verified|  Check in at Port Vila was somewhat chaotic in the Domestic Terminal, however certain check in desks for certain flights ensured you checked in for your flight on-time. Very strict closing times for check in, be warned to check in on time. Boarding announcements were not very clear and any announcements were very hard to hear due to echo in the terminal. Boarding was efficient, greeted by the Smiling crew and that was it really. Pre takeoff checks and we didn't see the crew again until the pre-landing checks were done. There is NO refreshments offered, so take your own. We did on this flight and so glad that we did. Beautiful views to be had heading north to Santo, however things turned to custard on coming into Santo. It was mid-afternoon when the thunderstorms tend to pop up and we could not land at Santo due to the weather. We then endured another 75 minutes back to Port Vila where more chaos ensued. I must say it was the Australians and Americans who were demanding on arrival, wanting compensation and accommodation, their pleas went unanswered as weather issues are not the responsibility of the airline folks.. Found our own hotel for the night, turned up back at the Airport the next afternoon for our replacement flight and off we flew back to Santo and landed on a beautiful afternoon. Cabin crew again were full of smiles on boarding and deplaning, but really they did nothing else. Aircraft was clean, toilet was clean and announcements on the aircraft were much clearer than on some airlines we have travelled. In fairness to Air Vanuatu, they got us there and back and then there again safely, they accommodated us onto an extra special flight due to the disruption, you could not ask for anything else."
Air Vanuatu,"✅Trip Verified|  We were booked to go to Vanuatu on Tuesday 24 October. Our check in was delayed 1 1/2 hours due to ‘mechanical issues’. Then delayed another hour for it to then be cancelled. We waited around for another hour for you to sort accommodation for us. We were then stuck in Auckland waiting for a new flight with no car, no warm clothes etc. Our new flight time was Thursday 26 October at 1.30pm. This was also then delayed until 8pm. Another day of us waiting around in Auckland. Just as we were getting ready to head to the airport for check in, we found out the flight had once again been delayed! We had had enough by this point and our travel agent ended up getting us on a flight to go back home. Throughout this whole ordeal we have had zero communication or updates from Air Vanuatu, only through our travel agent who was also having trouble getting any answers. We understand there has been a cyclone but we have wasted three days of our holiday waiting around for flights and answers! We were looking forward to this holiday only to have to cancel it. We won’t be flying Air Vanuatu again, purely because of the lack of communication and willingness to give us any answers or updates on what was happening with our flights. Very disappointing!"
Air Vanuatu,"✅Trip Verified|  Changed flight details 3 times to only cancel the flight 2 hours before leaving the airport. The airline has left us high and dry with no other information since informing us of the cancellation at 11:30am. It is now 1am the following day. Office is not available outside of business hours and when you can get in touch with them, they can’t tell you anything. Terrible communication and professionalism. Phone line actually cut out mid conversation and they didn’t bother to call back, and that’s when I could get through! Language communication barriers weren’t helpful either and their support team seemed clueless and unable to help at all. We were told by Flight Centre that they are planning a flight on a Monday. This is 3 days after the original departure date. Our holiday was only for 5 nights. I can’t understand how an international airline could have no leasing arrangements with Qantas as they are affiliated with them and the flight numbers are NF and QF. To cancel an international flight with no further communication or support is disgraceful. To not have an emergency flight organised for the next day is really unethical and unfair on paying customers. To make customers wait 3 days for a flight is unacceptable. Terrible customer service. I won’t ever trust Air Vanuatu with my holiday again. What a roller coaster ride. We booked through flight centre and flight centre were not updated by the airline with all of their changes on multiple occasions. We had to ring our travel agent about the cancellation as they had no idea. No one has any idea about anything. Great customer service is gone."
Air Vanuatu,"✅Trip Verified|  Cancelled flight for 25 hours then re scheduled flight two hours late, by the time we got to Vanuatu and resort it was 4.00am. 1 accommodation day wasted. Return trip - sat on tarmac 1.5 hours late, 1 toilet only due to one being broken, line up to use, still broken on return trip. Qantas in partnership booked through Qantas for this airline. We went into Air Vanuatu to pre select our seats so our family were all together, when we got on the flight we were all separated. I was in an aisle away from my husband and our other 4 members were moved elsewhere. Disgusting. Losing one day gave us only 5 days and was very tired on the first day. Poor form, anything related to Qantas seems to be very poor of late."
Air Vanuatu,"Not Verified|  Our flight was cancelled when we were in the check-in queue. The customer service was dreadful and there was no advice on when the flight would be reinstated. We booked with another airline after realising that the flight would be grounded for at least three days (the airline only has one plane). We are still waiting for a refund. The Air Vanuatu website says that the wait for refunds is 'indefinite""."
Air Vanuatu,"Not Verified|  Air Vanuatu cancelled our flights. Promised a refund, never received. Lots of emails promising a refund, but it's all lies. Every email thanks us for our patience and they will sort the refund. Now they dont ever bother to answer out correspondence. Look like we have lost $4360."
Air Vanuatu,"✅Trip Verified|  Air Vanuatu the nightmare that never stops. Flew from Fiji to Vanuatu on April 11th and they off loaded our luggage without telling us. When we arrived they informed us we could fill in a missing luggage form and that maybe they’d be able to bring it over in the next couple of days. Our flight to Sydney was scheduled for April 14th and that only gave them 3 days to sort it out. We proceeded to have to come in every day, to their office in Port Vila as well as the airport to ask for the compensation that was clearly stated on their website. 7000 vatu a day per person for a maximum of 3 days. They didn’t want to honour this as they claimed the policy had changed but wasn’t updated yet on the website. After repeatedly showing up they finally accepted to pay for 2 days. In the end they weren’t able to bring our luggage over so we requested for it to be sent to Sydney as our terrible nightmare of a vacation was nearly over. However one day before departure they cancelled our flight. The one Boeing they use for international flights had mechanical problems. Customer service is horrendous, they’re unhelpful, hang up the phone and told us what’s the big deal? It’s only one extra day. The big deal was that our luggage was still not with us, imagine not having access to clean clothes for 4 days in a hot country. Do not book this airline."
Air Vanuatu,✅Trip Verified|  The delay was almost twice as long as the flight time itself. Barely any announcements or updates were made. Poor families with children aimlessly waiting in the boarding area. They have a notorious history of delays. Sometimes they outsource to others like Naru Airlines. Do yourself a favor and take Aircalin or any other carrier instead. This company hurts Vanuatu’s tourist industry.
Air Vanuatu,"✅Trip Verified|  Terrible customer service. We were due to fly for a 7 day holiday on Saturday, the night before (Friday) we got an email that simple said ""Your flight has been cancelled there will be a further update on Monday"" There was no support or information on what we should do. On Facebook they kept saying to call the team for assistance, yet no one could get an answer. Since then emails have gone unanswered or they rudely respond with one line and no answer to your actual question. We ended up not being able to have our holiday yet we had paid for everything. Travel insurance doesn't cover mechanical issues, the airline should. Trying to get our refund has been impossible, they said the time frame for a refund is indefinite. It's been 8 weeks so far. I've never experienced such terrible customer service and sadly on something that has left us very out of pocket!"
Air Zimbabwe,"✅Trip Verified| Victoria Falls to Harare. Never choose this company. Departure times cannot be relied. Our flight departed 3.5 hours earlier than it should've. We were only informed the previous day in the evening. We couldn't make it to the flight and went to the airport to book a new one. Customer service at the airport was terrible. The staff was arrogant and shouted at us. Also, there was supposed to be another flight with Air Zimbabwe that day, but for no reason they didn't fly it. Don't choose this airline."
Air Zimbabwe,"✅Verified Review|  When we purchased our ticket online we were not informed that we would be flying direct from Victoria Falls to Johannesburg however it was explained to us at airport check-in that the flight was was Victoria Falls > Bulawayo > Jo'burg. The flight was delayed about 30 minutes in Vic Falls and we deplaned when we arrived at Bulawayo Airport and eventually re-boarded a larger plane. Communication wasn’t great but we spoke with another passenger who took this flight more regularly and this was apparently the norm. Aside from the fact that it was ""free seat"" meaning pick any available seat regardless of what was indicated on boarding pass, the flight went well. I would not recommend this flight if you have a tight connection, it would be wise to leave yourself sufficient room for delays. Most countries charge a departure tax when leaving by air. Often the tax is automatically added to the airline ticket price but not always, as is the case with Air Zimbabwe so be prepared to pay 50USD, cash before going through security."
Air Zimbabwe,"✅Verified Review|  Harare to Johannesburg. I had a very bad experience with Air Zimbabwe and particularly the agent through which I bought my ticket - Geostar (a Portuguese agent). I booked a flight for 7am from Harare, and the flight was postponed indefinitely. Upon arriving at the airport, the front desk cashier demanded $50 airport taxes be paid in addition to the ticket that was already bought. Neither Geostar nor Air Zimbabwe bothered to inform me of the change in travel times. After requesting a refund, it has been 28 days of back and forth emails from the agent and the airline. No concrete answers or commitment. Just incorrect credit notes being sent to me."
Air Zimbabwe,"✅Verified Review|  I enjoyed my flight aboard Air Zimbabwe from Harare to Johannesburg, the crew were very friendly and the service was excellent. We arrived ahead of schedule, check-in was fast and smooth and the seats were comfortable."
Air Zimbabwe,"✅Verified Review| Harare to Johannesburg with Air Zimbabwe. Tickets on Air Zimbabwe are not cheaper than other airlines. At the airport you will need to pay an additional US$50 per person than if you fly using another airline. This is because Air Zimbabwe has not paid the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) the taxes for past passengers so now the CAAZ obtains these taxes directly from passengers as they are about to leave. If you fly BA or SAA, these taxes are included in the tickets. Also note that online ticket websites (we used GoToGate) do not publish the additional US$50 or any such information on their sites so that you purchase tickets through them only to receive a very nasty surprise at Harare airport. The flight experience on Air Zimbabwe itself was not bad."
Air Zimbabwe,With an unexpected weekend off in Harare and Victoria Falls beckoning Air Zim was the only option so we took a deep breath and booked. Outbound flight on 27-year-old B732 which left the stand with the precision of a Swiss train at 0800 and zero seconds. Served a reasonable snack and coffee and on-time arrival. Return flight on Sunday was on a leased E145 fully booked with departure from the stand 5 minutes early and again nice snack and drink en route. The crew was 75% SAA. Overall could have no complaints at all.
Air Zimbabwe,Living and working in South Africa I fly home to Zimbabwe fairly often and try to be patriotic and use the national airline. I have only been delayed once in the past year. Food is good and service also of acceptable standards. Ggetting through to the Joburg offices is another story altogether - overall I think Air ZIm are doing the best they can with the resources at their disposal.
Air Zimbabwe,Harare-London-Harare. Originally booked flight on Friday which was cancelled. Flights were punctual and staff friendly. Old planes and no entertainment. But being the only direct flight to Europe from Harare and with prices less then half of any other airline still OK for anybody wanting a cheap flight to London as long as one has the flexibility to cope with changes of schedule.
Air Zimbabwe,I was on my flight back from London. There is never any inflight entertainment on your long haul journeys and yet they is a projector onboard - very disappointing. One of the flight attendants back chats when I ask for a refreshment because I could not sleep - he tells me sir do you know it is four in the morning! It is not good to arrive at the airport and get told that the aircraft has to stop over in Lusaka to refuel!.
Air Zimbabwe,I thought I would try out Air Zimbabwefrom Harare as it is a direct flight to London and I dislike the long wait at Joburg airport when flying SAA/BA etc. However having had my Wednesday night flight postponed until Thursday then that cancelled until Friday then Friday flight cancelled without a single reason or apology. I figure 5 hours in Joburg is a small price to pay. Shame on you Air Zimbabwe. Never again.
AirAsia,✅Trip Verified|   I would like to write about the splendid service given to me & my spouse by Air Asia AK 376 (Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar) on 1.11.2024 (Friday). I'm so proud to mention about these two cabin crew Ms Camelia & Mr Amirul. Their love and care  is still lingering in our mind. Kudos to Air Asia to have them in their crew family. Our most sincerest gratitude. Love you guys a lot & our best wishes in your future.
AirAsia,✅Trip Verified| Great airline. You get what you pay for. Outstanding staff. Do not listen to all the negative reviews online. Have never had a bad experience / problem.
AirAsia,"Not Verified| We found too many communications between the AirAsia staff which caused inconveniences for passengers, to walk a very long distance (back and forth for more than 5 hours) in the airport, and faced a very unhelpful ground manager, all of these making the rescheduling process very difficult and confusing, and ended up with none, we eventually still need to stay at the airport until almost dawn. This is a very exhausting experience."
AirAsia,"✅Trip Verified| The worst airline ever, they had a delay without explaining the reason. And we missed 2 other flights because of that, and still they refused to give us a compensation for the damages, although their agent at the service counter promised us we would get the compensation because it was the company’s fault. They told us to book our new tickets (because of course we are not going to stay in Kuala Lumpur) and then they told us to apply for the compensation online, then guess what they did? They told us we apologize we can’t give you a compensation. That’s it. And they closed our case. I have flown with numerous airlines and visited 16 countries so far, I have never seen worse than this airline. I wish I had never bought a ticket with them and if there’s one thing I regret the most in my life, it’s flying with them."
AirAsia,"✅Trip Verified|   Extremely disappointed with cabin crew service. Travelled with wife and toddler, with only 3 cabin baggage (2 regular size bags that can be placed under seats and 1 cabin size Quinton Roxy stroller properly packed into a cabin sized bag) from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore via AK717 on 29th September 2024. While boarding the flight, chief flight attendant stopped me and asked me to check in my stroller instead, reasoning that today's flight is full and my cabin-sized stroller is too big. Reasoned to cabin crew that I bought three seats in total and I only need one space for my stroller so that I can use my stroller after I land in Singapore immediately, without the need to travel to the baggage carousel to collect it. After all passengers boarded the plane, crew asked her colleagues to come over our seats and said that there are no more cabin space and asked us to check in our stroller. Seeing other passengers loading 2 or even 3 bags to the cabin space, I do not understand why must they target my stroller to be checked in instead of other passenger's luggages. Ultimately passed my stroller to the Crew, and gotten the assurance that I will be able to collect my stroller at the doorside area after I land in Singapore. As what we have expected, they did not pass the message to Singapore's land staff and our stroller was transported to the luggage carousel."
AirAsia,"✅Trip Verified| Rating an airline is usually about adhearance to schedule timing, crew professionalism, service - if any, and possibly pricing and on each of which AirAsia fail miserably as clearly seen in most reviews. The soundness and safety of the aircraft should not be ever a noticed deficiency, but that was the case of flight Z2 286 on Sep/25. On start, 20 minutes were added to the usual careless delay of 30 minutes, the ground and the air crews were, as usual, busy among themselves and indifferent of passengers and their needs, and the aircraft was a total mess. My seat would not stay upright, it moved backwards at will. The ""biblical"" excerpts glued to the back of the seats was nothing leser than forcing the Christian's religion upon others, and with that came the dripping condensation from everywhere. At destination we waited in the aircraft for 24 minutes for lack of gates. To me, flying AirAsia is the second worst thing a person would do. The discounted prices should not be a reason to accept humiliation."
AirAsia,"Not Verified|  I was done with Jetstar a couple of years ago when they were cancelling flights left, right and center causing lots of stress and expense. We now fly AirAsia to Bali. We arrived back in Perth after a month in Bali on 4 September 2024. We had 25kgs of luggage, a meal and exit row seating. Check is was very smooth as was ordering by groups. Pretty much took off on time except has to wait for departing aircraft in front of us. The staff were wonderful, the seating good and the food excellent choice (pre booked). I have no complaints whatsoever and we are off back to Bali with Air Asia today."
AirAsia,"Not Verified|   Just had return flight Perth to Bali. Efficient boarding process, friendly crew onboard. Pre-ordered food was good both trips. Generally very efficient and helpful staff. App-based processes, eg. boarding passes etc, worked well. Overall very good value for money. Better than Jetstar."
AirAsia,✅Trip Verified| Flew from Don Mueang airport with Air Asia. I’ve never had a bad flight with them. I class then as a clinical low cost airline. Crew is always nice and buy on board options available. For a one hour flight there was zero complaints.
AirAsia,"✅Trip Verified| They didn’t tell me at check in counter that I couldn’t bring my tripod. I could brought it from KL to here via hand carry bag but from Medan to KL cannot. They didn’t tell us beforehand and told us that we as passengers need to ask what we can bring and cannot bring. It’s utterly ridiculous and doesn’t make any sense, I need to ask all items in my bags 1 by 1? They should put it in writing if that item is not allowed. Or at least told us when checking in. It’s really a stupid airline and please do not use AirAsia."
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified| I had booked this fare at a very discounted rate as I needed to travel back to BLR. The check in experience was good, I had arrived early and there was still time for check in to open so I was told to wait for 30 mins before check in in my luggage. Post that I had noticed that the inbound was delayed due to which the departure was also slightly delayed by 40 mins. The crew were welcoming and this flight was not completely full. During boarding I had noticed that a lot of people had come with trolleys and they were told to check in their luggage which is good as a lot of folks come carrying big trolleys that just block the cabin overhead bins. The flight tried to make time en route and landing in BLR was swift along with luggage retrieval. One point to note here is that the seat pitch may be on the tighter side compared to other airlines but otherwise this was a good trip where the crew also distributed water bottles to everyone during boarding."
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified| I travel at least four times a month and Air Asia truly ruins any flight that I have to unwillingly take with them. With the horrible past experiences I made it a point to never book this airline but some times due to emergencies I had to resort to this and as I expected I was so furious and disappointed by the end of it. The staff isn’t trained at all and I don’t think they’re equipped for basic customer management. They are angry, rude and unbothered. Worse is, I think they’re so frustrated with where they are working"
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified| Taking this opportunity to appreciate and thank the entire team of I5 792 for providing amazing service and support during the entire journey and making it a memorable one. I have traveled a lot however this was the first time for my parents and trust me it could not have been better than this if it wasn’t the crew who made it happen, specially Mr Shubham the cabin supervisor. He is extremely polite, professional and empathetic. He treated my family like his own and was very polite and respectful to all the other customers as far I noticed. I wish to see cabin crew like him on all flights because they are the ones who make a difference. Would also like to highlight his amazing announcements, loud and clear unlike many other. Once again thank you everyone for an amazing experience hope to see you all in future on AirAsia flights."
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified| The worst airlines in the history of mankind. Absolutely hate it, won't recommend at all. Stay away from it and go for Indigo or Akasa. Waste of time and money."
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified|  Would like to give big thumbs up to boarding crew Ms Noor at Tiruchirappalli Airport. We are four family, flying from Trichy(India) to Singapore). Boarding process went very smooth with her providing detailed explanation before keep luggage, what can bring and what cannot, She is quite knowledgeable and inform the passenger upfront to complete the boarding process smooth and fast."
AirAsia India,Not Verified|  My mother travelled alone in Air Asia on 07 June 2023. The flight was very comfortable. Services were good. Ground staff was extremely helpful. Sincere thanks to the ticketing staff.
AirAsia India,✅Trip Verified|  I will like to thank entire staff of Air Asia. We were on family vacation with my 2.6 year old child and got amazing cooperation. Without any hassle we could book seats and the entire journey was enjoyable. Will like to be thankful to the pilots as the landing on all the flights was smooth. I paid my gratitude to the staff personally too.
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified|  Special appreciation to the cabin crew Sonika. I was super impressed with her fluency in announcements, all three different languages and it was just amazing to hear her out."
AirAsia India,"✅Trip Verified|  I was supposed to be travelling from Bangalore to kochi on the AirAsia flight on March 23. We reached the Airport on time but because they didn't mention that the flight is in the newly launched terminal. We were late to reach the boarding gate but even though there was still time to board the flight, the crew didn't allow to board the flight. We knew this because when we where waiting to leave from the second terminal 15 minutes after not allowed entry another Airasia crew asked tried to help us to board the same flight 15 minutes after being denied entry. This is completely unacceptable behaviour unexpected from AirAsia India and we will make sure not to choose this flight again in future."
AirAsia India,✅Trip Verified| Airline staff helped me with last minute web check in cancellation also helped locating the luggage and provided the best support and service. 5/5 for such hospitality and customer delight
AirAsia Philippines,"✅Trip Verified| It was bad from the start to finish. They gave my spouse and child second-class treatment for some reason and put us behind other customers at the check-in desk. They then gave us extra payment for every fraction of a kilo after the decimal. I went to the customer service and complaint desk at the airport authority and they changed their tune. I also afterwards complained to the hotline on the website and they closed my complaint promptly without a response for some reason. The conclusion I have is Air Asia Philippines is worst. The air conditioning on the flight kept turning on and off, so we were going between sweating bullets in the back of the plane and freezing ourselves the entire flight. Also, for some reason, the plane was going straight through the turbulence without adjusting the course or altitude for 3 1/2 hours. We also had to takeoff tarmac one hour and 45 minutes us 2 1/2 hours late overall for our arrival in Don Mueng Airport at Bangkok. Thanks for the worst customer service and follow up. They also refuse to accept my Malaysian ringet for my meal."
AirAsia Philippines,"Not Verified|  It is my first time flying with them because I saw good reviews so I want to give it a chance. Yet, I made a mistake.  The flight is supposed to be 8:50pm that was rescheduled to 1:15 am the following day and when we arrived at the airport that was changed again to 2am. The most unreliable airline."
AirAsia Philippines,"Not Verified|   This review is for their AirAsia ASEAN Explorer Pass and for total lack of a way to contact customer service.  They do not give you any way to contact them, except perhaps to drive to the airport and hope to speak to someone. I suspect that is not going to be successful. Not, for the ASEAN Explorer Pass. I purchased it for me and for my wife. What they don't tell you: It's nearly impossible to book on weekends. You cannot check availability unless you have purchased the pass already. So you buy the pass and hope it is worth it. If you can travel weekends, perhaps it is. Otherwise, don't buy it. Availability during the week: They post a seemingly convenient way to check for seat availability. But when you try to book on an indicated available date, you'll get a message saying those dates are not available for purchase with the ASEAN Pass. It is an extremely frustrating experience. Needless to say, I can't contact anyone, except for the idiotic and useless bot, ""Bo"" which is a complete insult to their customers."
AirAsia Philippines,"✅Trip Verified|  Entire flight was smooth, however boarding time was a little confusing and the assigned gate, they suddenly changed it so it caused more confusion. I ordered pre-book meal, it tasted good but the food itself was somehow cold. For me, airline’s baggage policy was highly favorable as I was able to check in 30 kilos regardless of number of luggage."
AirAsia Philippines,"✅Trip Verified|  My wife and I booked the Premium Flex ticket for our flight from Caticlan (MPH) to Manila (MNL). This should have given us the option to change our flights quite flexible. This is done in the online account. To login you need to verify your email address and phone number with an OTP. This OTP is not being send to my phone number from the UAE. You have 3 chances and then you have to wait 24 hours for the next try. Which again didn't work, as nowhere is written that the OTP is not being send to most countries. The entire online customer service is done by a badly programmed chatbot. There is no option to talk or chat with a real person. Theoretically you can change the flight with the chatbot. For this you have to enter all kind of data. And at the end it doesn't recognize the correctly entered email address, which is associated with the booking. So the option of using the flex-ticket is not possible from our country. The flight had more than 1 1/2 hours delay. On a day of good weather. Eventually we had 20 seconds of spare time until missing our check-in closure for our next flight. Fortunately we were lucky, after running and telling the taxi driver in Manila to drive as fast as possible. We told the ground staff in Caticlan about our situation. A quick airport transfer would have helped us a lot instead of waiting for our suitcases and then needing 15 min to drive from Terminal 2 to 3 in Manila. Again, the customer service was pretty bad. Dealing with all this at an airport where the wifi is not working is the worst possible situation. Especially you don't want to have this stress on the last day of a beautiful vacation. The only good thing is the friendly and pretty cabin crew. After my flight I get daily mails from AirAsia. Clicking on the unsubscribe button doesn't work. We will not fly with AirAsia anymore."
AirAsia Philippines,✅Trip Verified|  Twice in a single week we have been delayed. First time  was a couple hours- but when the plane arrived in Manila they immediately off loaded passenger and load us. With about 15 minutes notice. Second flight has been delayed repeatedly and is now over 3 hours late. Terminal has no real concessions available and the room temp is maintained in the 60’s. Total disregard for passengers comfort.
AirAsia Philippines,"✅Trip Verified|  My flight was postponed from 12.35 pm to 3.05 pm and I booked the flight the day before to January 3, 2024, 12.35 pm. This flight was postponed 3.05 pm. I will never fly with this low-cost airline again."
AirAsia Philippines,"Not Verified|  After multiple voicemails (with no response) and multiple attempts at using AirAsia's online agent, I'm now too late to reschedule my flight to an earlier time. I had to call into a voicemail first in order to talk to an actual human. Including the multiple reschedules on the way into Iloilo that AirAsia has added to our vacation, their terrible customer service makes them one of the worst airlines.  In my opinion, no one should have to suffer the same way I have in dealing with this service, especially when there is so much competition."
AirAsia Philippines,"✅Trip Verified|  We booked 4 flights with this airline. Either on the day, shortly before the flight or a day before the flight date, they changed the flight time. And i don't mean to a reasonable time. For example, one flight was changed from 3pm to 2:20am the following morning. Absolutely unreliable airline - do not book with them if you have connecting flights, if you have booked trips or activities, if you intend to be somewhere at a certain time or time period. Some delays are acceptable but changing 75% of flight times is incredibly disruptive, poor planning and embarrassingly poor customer customer services. Incredible that they can offer you a flight date, time and price and then change it a day before you fly."
AirAsia Philippines,"✅Trip Verified|  Hours of flight delay, flight cancellation, wasting your time booking with this airline. I travelled the world and utilized many airlines. This by far IS the worst airline. They need to reconsider the way they organized their operations. Wasted my time with this airline, my first and will be my last with AirAsia Philippines."
AirAsia X,"Not Verified| AirAsia changed the flight I booked from going Bangkok to Sydney non-stop. I booked it on the basis that I did not want a stopover (especially for hours in Kuala Lumpur Airport). I requested a refund after they changed me to stop in Kuala Lumpur. Their refund policy is that they assess the refund request within one month. I queried after a month why I was not getting any assistance. I escalated the request 3 times with no response. Insult to injury you cannot speak to anyone you can only communicate to a chat bot called Bo that has very limited communication parameters and is ineffectual, to say the least. After 3 escalations zero feedback or anything, I have still no answers and no refund. I originally lodged my request on 28 July 2024. It is now coming up to 3 months I have waited with still NO feedback or resolution at all."
AirAsia X,"Not Verified|  On 22/10/2023 we booked 2 tickets to fly Sydney to Bangkok on 28/06/2024. Air Asia cancelled the flight on 23/03/2024 and offered us either refunds or seats on a flight 3 days later. The deferred flight was not an option for us as we had booked accommodation, so we chose the refunds. Despite many attempts to contact the airline the refunds have not been received. Their reply is always the same - they are being processed. It is now 1/09/24 and still no refunds."
AirAsia X,"✅Trip Verified|  Booked to travel from Kuala Lumpur to Taiwan on 9th Jun, 2024. After check-in and immigration process, when it's time to board their staff told my visa for Taiwan cannot be used because her last name is filled with the first name and visa must be printed on paper. My name has no last name so I usually fill the last name with my first name because for most form last name is mandatory. Anyway I applied my visa again and fixed the last name and printed it. They again insist visa must be printed in color. I tried to find place for printing in the airport but cannot find. After already too late they said black and white print will be fine.  In addition they ask me to buy new ticket with zero refund. Their service is terrible, the staff and lack proper training."
AirAsia X,"✅Trip Verified|  I miss my Malaysia Airlines flight and all flight is closed and do not allow to purchase. However AirAsia is so kind to let me get a ticket, even though the counter is closed after listening to my ordeal in the airport. Thank you AirAsia for making my trip possible! Appreciate the guy that help me, too rush to get his name. Thank you!"
AirAsia X,"Not Verified|  Flight got cancelled. Not notified. Next flight 15hrs later. No compensation. Return flights changed (cancelled). Stop over in Kuala Lumpur scheduled to be for 5mins, when I have to collect baggage and go through immigration. Get flight changed and they then want to charge me for changing it, when it was their mistake. Can’t chat with a manager. Refuse to give their work emails. One day lost of my holiday, 2 days lost at resort I was supposed to be staying at, 8hrs of rebooking whole flights and holiday. Absolutely no care given. No compensation, nothing. I’ve never seen such incompetence and malaise."
AirAsia X,"✅Trip Verified|  Appalling service. My checked bag was not off loaded at Sydney from Auckland and continued on to KL. Could not contact anyone at Swissport or AirAsia , they did not answer my calls and AirAsia has no representation at Sydney airport and has no call center, only useless bots on line chat. I only got my bag by personally returning to the airport two days later and screaming blue murder at the overwhelmed swissport agents.  Two days of my holiday wasted."
AirAsia X,"✅Trip Verified|  AirAsia cancelled the return flight of the journey. Their AI chat bot was no help at all with flights cancelled by the airline. Finally managed to get their customer support number and it was only a message bank. They emailed me and I asked to get credit specifically only for the return phase of the journey. They cancelled the whole flight! Since I am flying two days after this cancellation, I had no choice but to book again. And it became more expensive now, obviously because the date of booking is nearer the date of departure. I couldn’t risk waiting for their customer support to get back to me as I might miss my appointments in Auckland."
AirAsia X,"✅Trip Verified|  They ceased operation of KUL-SYD-AKL route, and replaced by KUL-OOL-AKL route. I bought this ticket for October / November 2024 because of the 2024/2025 promotion. The flight cancelled notification was receive on October, a month after the promotion. If you know you want to change the route, why you still sell the ticket. I book the flight departure on end of October and return on November. However, they only allow me change the flight until end of Oct 2024. That means I am unable make any changes in November. When I request of refund they reply me and want me either to take credit point or ""voucher + other option""."
AirAsia X,"Not Verified|  Crew very polite but didn't understand English. No free blanket, food or water was provided. No entertainment screen in 9 hour long flight .Never booking again"
AirAsia X,"✅Trip Verified|   I believe it’s important to emphasise that AirAsia X is not the same as AirAsia itself, and that a 7/10 Skytrax overall rating is pretty much as good as it gets for any airline. Even the best in the world like Qatar, Emirates and Singapore Airlines rarely have ratings above 7/10 because passengers mostly come to Skytrax to air their grievances but never sing praises whenever the job is done well. Booking a lie-flat business class seat on AirAsia X’s Airbus A330 was probably the most value-for-money upgrade around. For just about USD50 more I got to enjoy a lie-flat seat, meal service and upsized baggage. Most certainly it isn’t full-service business class like on the full-service carriers, but at this price point there really isn’t much room for dissatisfaction especially when the crew did their job well. Most importantly the flight departed on time and landed safely on time. Overall a very pleasant experience with AirAsia X, and in my opinion a massive difference as compared to the regular AirAsia."
AirAsia Zest,✅Verified Review|  Manila to Kalibo. I am a frequent flier of AirAsia. I am always happy with the service that I am getting. Staff are really friendly. This is a short trip to fulfil a holiday and fantastic service. The best part is being able to sit within the exit row without paying for this.
AirAsia Zest,"Now everyone can fly because of cheap fares. In a way this is a good thing. However, I don't think it brings about all good things. Low cost, on the other hand, can also mean low quality. You basically get what you pay for. My flight with Air Asia Zest to Hong Kong from Manila had more of the negatives than the positives. To begin with, our flight was delayed for over three hours at Manila Airport. The aircraft was delayed in an airport somewhere. We were asked to move gates three times that just made everyone confused. None of their ground crew came to inform and reassure passengers at least. When the aircraft finally arrived, another complication happened. The air bridge was not working, so, we had to go down the stairs to the tarmac then stairs (again) to the aircraft. Perhaps we burned some calories but all of us got wet - it was raining heavily then. Passenger comfort was basic and the food I pre-ordered was not to my liking. We arrived four hours late in Hong Kong. AirAsia will get you to destination, that's it. Customer service and passenger comfort is not a priority for this airline."
AirAsia Zest,"AirAsia Zest is a low-cost airline with weak ground service and delayed on my flight, with misleading information on when the flight will depart. Aircraft look nice, but there is no entertainment system. They can have very cheap flights, but costs are sometimes hidden and if the flight is canceled or seriously delayed, a cheap ticket was of no help."
AirAsia Zest,"My AirAsia Zest flight was a short flight from Manila to Cebu, but a good trip. I arrived 20 minutes earlier than scheduled, my seats were upgraded for free and my check in luggage arrived on time in the baggage claim. Everything was good but unfortunately during my flight they took off the headrest covers on the seats, and the head rest looks unclean. For money I paid for and the service I got I was satisfied."
AirAsia Zest,The ground staff in Puerto Princesa Airport and air crew of flight Z2 427 were so kind and understanding. I have traveled via AirAsia (Philippines) 4 times and I haven't encountered any problems with them. I always find their crew friendly. The online booking is easier to navigate and payment process is smooth compared to the trouble I experienced with the other local airline.
AirAsia Zest,"Airline ground counter staff very unfriendly and unprofessional, unable to make any decision in favor to the customer. Though I checked in very early as sequence no. 3 the system assigned me the very uncomfortable middle seat B. The ground staff at KLIA2 fortunately helped me to find another seat since the flight was not fully booked. Cabin staff most of the time busy with themselves, took them 2 hours after departure to serve the first meals and drinks. The passengers who pre-ordered meals got served first, the rest had to wait more. Scheduling and cancellation policy worst ever. Flight scheduled for 23rd of August was confirmed by mail on 19th of July but suddenly cancelled on 29th of July. At a very short notice I had to book another flight which was of course more expensive."
AirAsia Zest,Airport used was the old Manila Domestic Airport dubbed the Terminal 4 and confuses you of a newer terminal but in fact it's an old terminal with no jetbridges and there is very poor ventilation. Zest Air is a disaster for Air Asia because it cannot be a part of the best budget airline in the world. Their airport staff in Manila are not friendly. Seat of your choice cost PhP100 even on check-in which is free-of-charge on other airlines. Their aircraft's are old and the painting is filthy (dirty) and the seat covers are torn and dirty. The cabin smells and the air conditioning is very poor. The plane I was on had several defective lights throughout the cabin making it darker. The flight attendants were friendly though but still the whole experience was a nightmare. I will never fly this airline again.
AirAsia Zest,Airport staff this time were as efficient as you can get. Check in was kind of a slow process and they do need to learn how to prioritize their lines. Not once did we get a final check in or express check in at the check in counters. By the time I got to immigration we had 20 minutes until our flight left luckily enough the immigration let us cut the line. It didn't really matter because we arrived at the gate to basically stand there for 15 mins. Our departure was at 10.50am we are boarding at 10.50am. Onboard the aircraft my seat was cracked. Staff were quite rude constantly asking us to sit down while they played who to blame for the delay. Captain didn't say anything which I found rude. It was only after 30 minutes that he informed us we missed our time slot. Cabin was quite hot. I never seen such picky flight staff in my life asking anyone who moved seats why they were moving and to proceed back to their seat. For dinner there was no stock left no meal no sandwich no coke. We finally arrived in Cebu only an hour late. “You get what you paid for and I paid only $120.00 for two tickets.

AirAsia Zest,Flew TAG-MNL or at least attempted too on a low fare. After waiting 4 hours at the airport flight was canceled. Next flight with space for 8 people (my extended family) was in 3 days. We ended up taking a ferry to another city and taking another Zest flight which was itself late. No vouchers for hotel or food. Pure mayhem. Don't be fooled by the fact that Zest has a new airplanes (they do) as this missing part is how to operate them with efficiency.
airBaltic,Not Verified| On the evening flight a hot meal was ordered and added to the ticket for a 85 year old lady. When the meal arrived it was completely cold and not really appetizing. When stewardess was asked to heat the meal it was answered that only for a business class passengers they can use the microwave. AirBaltic really?
airBaltic,"✅Trip Verified|   First time to travel with airBaltic I flew AMS-RIX, then RIX-VNO and finally TLL-AMS as part of my Baltic trip. I was impressed with the aircrafts and their cleanliness of interior. All flights left on time and there was smooth boarding. Seats are comfortable and I loved the fact they still have the inflight magazine. No inflight individual entertainment screens. Food was for purchase which was on for those short flights. The only negative thing was on the TLL-AMS sector bathrooms were not clean. It’s not the airline fault but they should have checked it. And when we arrived in AMS disembarkation took forever as we were waiting for the buses (that’s the airport staff fault). But overall was a lovely experience."
airBaltic,"✅Trip Verified|   I recently experienced a significant delay with Air Baltic on a flight from Vienna to Riga that was delayed by over 5 hours, causing us to miss our connection and disrupt our entire travel plans. According to EU Regulation 261/2004, we are entitled to compensation since the delay exceeded 5 hours, and we chose not to board the delayed flight due to the impact on our schedule. Despite providing clear evidence of the delay and multiple attempts to assert our rights, Air Baltic has continuously denied our rightful claim for compensation. Their customer service team seems either unwilling or unable to correctly interpret the regulations, and their responses have been dismissive and unhelpful, referring us to dispute resolution bodies rather than addressing the issue directly. It is incredibly disappointing that a major airline would handle such a straightforward case in this manner. The refusal to comply with EU laws and the lack of proper customer service reflect poorly on Air Baltic. I would advise anyone flying with them to be prepared for similar issues, and if your flight is delayed, know that you might face a lengthy battle to receive the compensation you are legally entitled to. I am taking further steps to escalate this issue with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will not be flying with Air Baltic again unless they rectify this situation. Air Baltic, do better for your customers. Compliance with regulations and basic customer service should be a given, not a fight."
airBaltic,"Not Verified|  I am extremely disappointed with AirBaltic's service. The flight I was supposed to take with my family was significantly delayed, and we arrived at our destination 12 hours late. Due to this delay, we lost a day of work, incurred additional travel costs, and had to pay extra for pet sitting. I have made multiple attempts to claim compensation for these expenses, but AirBaltic has refused to reimburse even the meal expenses, despite the fact that we had no opportunity to eat during the 12-hour delay. This is unreasonable and shows poor customer service. All relevant receipts have been submitted, but AirBaltic has been unwilling to negotiate compensation at any level. I will never use AirBaltic's services again. This has been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience."
airBaltic,"✅Trip Verified| Smooth boarding process. Business seats on the A220 are standard European Business, economy with center seat blocked. Aircraft was immaculate. Very warm attentive staff for a 55-minute flight. Never and empty glass and attendants were visible and present for the entire flight. Swiss code share fight."

airBaltic,"✅Trip Verified|  Low cost airline. I asked for some water to take medication and the first answer from the crew was that I had to buy one, after complaining that this was a necessity for me to take a pill I was told I could get some free water but that it was not good to drink. What kind of airline is this?"
airBaltic,✅Trip Verified|  HEL-RIGA-HEL. Flights on time. Ticket prices affordable. New and clean aircraft. Flight attendants not so smiling but effective. One of my favourite airlines.
airBaltic,✅Trip Verified|   Flight got canceled. I called airline no one informed about my possibilities for alternative flight. Then day time got notification that alternative flight to Riga via Stockholm will be delayed by 2 hours so had to call again requesting alternative flight via Helsinki. Eventually final flight got delayed by another one hour - common practice as in order to avoid paying compensation they await other passengers with connections.
airBaltic,"✅Trip Verified|  AirBaltic delayed our baggage to Vilnius twice (in August and in November). And since Vilnius is not our final destination (we have to take a bus to cross the Schengen border to get to my hometown) we either have to stay and wait for the suitcases to arrive hopefully next day or arrange a suitcase delivery by ourselves. AirBaltic neither compensates any expenses we suffer from their incompetence nor delivers the suitcases to our hometown. Worst service onboard. Vilnius airport Lost & found section is always jammed with people claiming their luggage and suitcases waiting for delivery or pick up. As far as I can see it AirBaltic can forget a suitcase not only in transfer flights but in direct flights to Vilnius. I can't say any good words about KLM as well: we bought tickets from KLM site and expected them to reimburse expenses that we had since AirBaltic was their code sharing partner and European legislation allows us to choose which company to complain to (not only the Montreal convention). But the opened ticket for complaint was promptly closed with ""apply to Air Baltic"" and no possibility to object or re-submit the complaint with more details."
airblue,"✅Trip Verified|   I recently booked a flight with airblue, only to find out after payment that all the seats were already reserved! They took my money without informing me and issued a waiting list ticket instead. When I decided to cancel, they informed me that I'd have to wait 30 working days to receive a refund. This is completely unacceptable and feels misleading. I expected transparency and better customer service. If you’re considering flying with airblue, be cautious – they may not be upfront about seat availability, and their refund process is far from customer-friendly."
airblue,✅Trip Verified|   Awesome experience! The staff was so courteous. Food was tasty. Very good fellow travelers who made the experience even better. Even at Dubai Airport the manager in charge at check in has always been very helpful and is actively monitoring the interactions of people with the check in desk staff. Great experience.
airblue,✅Trip Verified| The service is good as a budget airline. Cabin crew is helpful. I did not encounter any bad issue along my flight. I will recomment this airline if oyur having a tight budget. The fares are reasonable.
airblue,✅Trip Verified|  A budget airline is a budget airline so the expectation is not that much. My recent flight with airblue was good. It was a smooth ride from Dubai to Lahore. The crew were very prompt with your request they are less enthusiastic as compared to other airline. They serve the food very late but it was a nice and palatable food. It was a good trip and the fares are reasonable. The ground staff in Dubai are friendly and have smooth and fast check in.
airblue,"Not Verified|   My recent encounter with Airblue was an absolute nightmare. Despite meticulously planning my trip and arriving at the airport on time, the flight was inexplicably delayed without a shred of consideration for the passengers. The staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than addressing our concerns, displaying a level of unprofessionalism that left me seething with frustration. To add insult to injury, there was zero effort made to provide any form of accommodation or assistance to the stranded travelers. It's as if they couldn't care less about the inconvenience they caused. Steer clear of Airblue at all costs."
airblue,"Not Verified|  Avoid them like the plague if you value your sanity and dignity. My recent experiences with Airblue have been nothing short of disastrous. Three times I've been subjected to their arbitrary policy changes, regardless of when I booked my ticket. From surprise seat charges to reneging on extra luggage allowances, their disregard for customer loyalty is staggering. Yet, the pinnacle of their incompetence came when they delayed my flight four times, only to cancel it at midnight without offering any assistance or accommodations. It's a shameful display of disregard for passenger well-being. In summary, flying with Airblue is an exercise in frustration and disappointment."
airblue,"✅Trip Verified|  Very bad experience, very bad staff who staff don't even have manners how to talk. Very bad food, I will never fly with them again."
airblue,Not Verified|  Worst experience with Dubai check in staff. I carried my laptop bag with me with a hand carry from Pakistan to Dubai. And they didn't allow the same bag with hand carry when coming back. I even adjusted the things in 1 hand carry still they were not accepting any extra weight fee to carry my things. Also the staff manager Uzair Ali was very disrespectful and not talking or guiding properly. He also gave me warning to cancel my flight as well. Had a better experience from Pak to Dubai still it was full of delays... First my flight was delayed then the plane came late and departed late as well. Worst food. Cabin crew was ok but everything else was so bad.
airblue,"Not Verified|  I had one of the worst experience with airblue travelling on 12 January 2024 from Dubai to Lahore. Flight was delayed few times and then boarding the plane while sitting for almost 3 hours with 2 announcements from the capital 1st one after more than 2 hrs and not even uttering the word sorry in both announcements. He didn't even tell the actual problem. After being offloaded from the plane, initially nobody advised about what is happening. then was advised flight will go next day. It took another 3hrs to get out of the airport (wasting almost 12 hours). We were advised to come at the airport 8am in the morning but no staff was present until 10am at the counter and even then passengers have to wait new boarding cards - so called creating new flight which wasn't done during the night or early morning."
airblue,"Not Verified|  For 13 years, I was a devoted customer, always choosing Airblue for my travels between Dubai and Lahore. But after my last interaction, that loyalty has been utterly shattered. My recent booking involved a roundtrip flight from Dubai to Lahore and back. Everything seemed straightforward until I added a request for additional luggage to my booking. This is when I encountered the baffling, newly-revised policy that essentially forces passengers to pay for their seats again, even though they already paid for their tickets. How does this make sense? Why should a simple baggage request trigger a demand for payment for seats already purchased? Seeking clarification, I contacted customer service, only to be placed on a lengthy hold, treated to vague responses, and ultimately told I'd have to cough up an additional 1000 PKR if I even wanted to change my seats. The sheer audacity of this demand left me speechless. This is not about the money. It's about the blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and the utter lack of logic behind this policy. It's about losing trust in an airline I've flown with for over a decade, all for the sake of 1000 PKR. Well, Airblue, consider this a goodbye. You've lost a loyal customer, and I'm certain I'm not alone. Your apathetic approach to customer service and this nonsensical policy will undoubtedly drive away those who once valued your airline. I urge you to reconsider this change, prioritize your passengers, and remember that good customer service is not a luxury, but a necessity for a thriving airline. With utter disappointment, A Former Customer of Airblue"
Aircalin,"✅Trip Verified|  The in-flight experience in Aircalin is quite decent. Friendly bi-lingual cabin crew, decent enough food and drinks, and a nice cabin overall. Where my experience really fell apart was the constant changes in flight times. I flew from Singapore to Noumea, then Noumea to Port Vila, before flying back to Singapore the same way. First there were minor half hour adjustments a few weeks after booking. This, in itself, is fine. Then my Noumea to Port Vila leg was rescheduled 2 weeks before departure, and I had to change my tickets because it was no longer possible to catch that flight (it took off before I landed in Noumea). Then (and this is most disappointing), my flight from Port Vila to Noumea got substantially changed just 4 days before departure. I was supposed to fly from Port Vila to Noumea at 10pm on a Monday night, so I would have spent the full day resting by the beach before heading to the airport and catching my flight. I would have then caught another flight to Singapore 1.5 hours later, having a swift but efficient transit in Noumea. The flight to Noumea got pulled forward to 11am in the morning, and thus, I spent the last day of my holiday sitting around in Noumea airport. No attempt at improving the situation was provided, and as we couldn't check our bags all the way through, me and other passengers on this itinerary were stuck at the airport all day lugging our suitcases around. No meaningful attempt at improving this situation was made by Aircalin. This is where the Aircalin experience really fell apart for me. I booked and paid to spend the last day of my holiday relaxing by the beach, then catching a night flight to Noumea, a swift layover, and a subsequent flight to Singapore. Instead, I had to wake up early to catch my flight to Noumea and spend my entire day at the airport. These 2 experiences are entirely different and considering the fact that I booked the 1st experience, it is not acceptable that I was stuck with the 2nd, with no meaningful recourse. The first experience is high-value and efficient, while the second experience is more reflective of a budget itinerary. As an airline, once you create a schedule, you should stick to it. Constantly changing the schedule, and messing around with passenger's itineraries is an easy way to leave a sour taste in their mouth, even if the inflight experience is decent."
Aircalin,"Not Verified|  A shame of airline. They have lost my luggage (same for 2 more colleagues) in august and I am still waiting for a refund (21/05/2023). They don't answer my mails and I had to pay to a lawyer to try to solve this issue. For me, the worst company ever"
Aircalin,"✅Trip Verified|  Fantastic flight. Despite a delay departing Narita due to weather, I really enjoyed my flight on Air Calin. The crew were fantastic - very friendly and helpful. Excellent onboard service, great food, a very comfortable seat and the cabin was clean. I would fly them again."
Aircalin,"Not Verified|  This review is written from the viewpoint of not actually being able to fly AirCalin, despite wanting to. One of my favourite airlines pre-Covid but right now, they're proving to be unreliable. A real shame. Booked my ticket through Air NZ utilising the AirCalin operated flight for a late afternoon flight home on Thursday 27th April, arriving early evening. And why not? A nice leisurely morning a swim at the beach before lunch, then heading to the airport. A pretty decent early dinner onboard with a good red for the 2 hour flight. Sounds good right? But AirCalin has other ideas. First flight reschedule received was to Friday (28/4) morning at 9 o'clock. Not exactly stellar having to leave the hotel at 5 am but ok, I'll just book another night at hotel. Now today, one week from holiday, the Friday flight has been cancelled outright and rebooked on Air NZ (still pretty good but lacking that certain je ne sais quoi these days). Two things grate. I now miss a friend's wedding on Saturday afternoon and I need to schlep my bag to another hotel (since the other hotel is now full on the Friday night). A shemozzle but at least Air NZ have rebooked flights, veg meal and seat selection without drama on the Saturday lunchtime flight. Thanks AirCalin for messing me about, not once but twice. If and when independence from France eventuates, AirCalin won't be able to hide behind Paris' largesse. It'll need to stand and deliver. That'll be interesting."
Aircalin,"Not Verified| When cabin crew ask for your feedback and thoughts on how they could improve you know they are genuinely committed to improving service. To be honest I could not fault them on our 2 hour 40mins flight. The plane was fairly new, very clean and the welcome aboard and service throughout exceptional. I had to compliment the crew on the food. The steak was perfect and tasted as if it had been cooked on-board. It bettered my steak experience from steak cooked on board in first class! I really look forward to flying Aircalin again and experiencing that level of customer service and care. Highly recommended"
Aircalin,"✅Trip Verified|  Absolute rubbish service today at the start and the end. Check in line for economy was huge. I had a Qantas ticket (codeshare) and am Platinum with Qantas so attempted to use the premium queue, which was not permitted. Despite not having clients, premium Check-in desks were not servicing economy clients, preferring to chat amongst themselves. Flight was ok. On arrival, no carousel information and bags took over 30 mins to commence delivery. A PA on ‘we’re sorry for late delivery and miss communication’ really doesn’t equate to being a reasonable service. I won’t fly Air Calin again."
Aircalin,✅Trip Verified| Melbourne to Nouméa. Surprisingly very good airline and good business seat for a three hours flight. Very good staff and very good product in business. Among them: Nikko Japanese whisky!
Aircalin,✅Trip Verified|  Noumea to Tokyo in economy and it was a good experience for a 8:30 hrs flight. The crew was warm and welcoming. The seat was comfortable with a lot of space for my legs and the entertainment system was complete. However the A330 cabin looked quiet old but these aircraft have to be replaced by mid 2019. The food was correct but not exceptional. Overall it was an appreciable flight.
Aircalin,"✅Trip Verified|  Nadi to Noumea. Aircalin is the only airline I have ever flown that does not allow for baby strollers, car seats or cots to be checked in without paying for additional luggage. Also beware when buying a fully refundable ticket. It is nearly impossible to cancel a flight on Aircalin. You can’t do it on line and you can’t do it over the phone. You can only do it in writing and then, if you are lucky, you may receive the refund 30 days later."
Aircalin,"✅Trip Verified| Flew Nadi, Fiji to Wallis Island. Aircalin is the flag carrier of New Caledonia and although a small airline, provided a good service. There were no boarding problems and the flight was on time. This was a very short flight and the cabin service was appropriate."
AirConnect,"✅Trip Verified|  Made and paid for the tickets in April. August get notice the time of departure changed. Then a week later notice that the airport has changed. A couple of days before the flight get a notice that the flight is cancelled. No alternate flight, no reason and no telephone response. Got message that my money was returned to EDreams. EDreams never got any money from AirConnect. AirConnect doesn't answer any emails. Filed dispute with bank. Had to book withTarom Air at double the price."
AIRDO,"✅Trip Verified|  Flew with AIRDO (a low cost airlines owned by ANA) from Tokyo Haneda to Hakodate. Flight was on time and full of passengers who were en route to observe the cherry blossoms in Hakodate. Cabin crew was really professional, friendly, and attentive. Legroom was good, seat was comfy, cabin was clean. Soft drinks (water, apple juice, tea, orange juice, coffee) was served to all passengers even it was a low cost airlines. Both of take off and landing were smooth."
Airlink,"✅Trip Verified| Return journey. Clean, modern aircraft, comfortable seat, tasty food and drying and great cabin crew. On the way back ground staff checked our bags through to EDI on BA even though we did not have the journey on a single ticket. Impressive and enjoyable journey and I would happily use them again."
Airlink,"✅Trip Verified|  Had a missing baggage when landing at Victoria Falls. Airlink's staff was very helpful in tracing and rerouting this baggage to Nairobi, where I was when they traced the baggage. Awesome customer experience."
Airlink,"✅Trip Verified|  Airlink do so much right and so many other carriers in the region can learn from them. Reliably on time (91% on time across all their flights into Jo'burg for example), great convenient connections through OR Tambo, Johannesburg for regional Southern Africa departures onto domestic SA ones; generous baggage allowance (30kg per passenger from Lusaka to SA), ever smiling welcoming cabin crew and check-in staff (on 4 sectors without exception); coupled with tasty cold meals on intl sectors and good South African wines and juices on all really help them to stand out alongside now even a loyalty rewards program. Keep doing what you do Airlink - we are so grateful and you will be rewarded with custom."
Airlink,✅Trip Verified|  My group of 6 checked in today but only 4 boarding passes were issued together with 2 payment requests for 3 kg excessive weight without telling us that two of our luggage’s were over 20kg or giving us a choice of removing some and putting them in the carry on bags. When we requested to do that the lady said the luggage’s already went inside and couldn’t be retrieved! No payment no boarding passes. Pathetic!
Airlink,✅Trip Verified|  I was super impressed with this airline. Highly recommend it for travel within Africa. I'm not sure what else to say. Glad airlink is available now for travel in Africa.
Airlink,"✅Trip Verified| If you have another option of airline like Cemair or Fastjet pick those ones instead. Airlink left me at the terminal after I was scheduled to fly to Blantyre in May. Their boarding gates closed early and despite all my attempts to make it through immigration, they left me on the tarmac. The plane was scheduled to leave at 11:20, boarding gates were closed by 10:55am and the last bus gone. They only called me at 12:30pm to say very rudely come and get your luggage, knowing that I was left behind. If they could have called me to come and get my luggage, why did they not call me cause I was at the airport, checked in online at 8am, checked in a bag, and they still left me. It is because they don’t care, and now I will never get my R5000 back, lost ticket, lost time, lost gifts. When I emailed them to complain, they said they will get back to me after 2 months time. So pick Airlink at your own risk, I will never ever fly with them again, even if they go to the outer parts of Africa, I will rather take a bus or donkey and wagon."
Airlink,"Not Verified|   Nice flight, on time. Smooth check in. Nice cafe after formalities at Windhoek. Only minor complaint is that email ticket confirmation says you must print out that document which is 2 or 3 pages, so I did for 3 people. These 9 pages were NOT required at Windhoek check in."
Airlink,"Not Verified|   It's unbelievable, I booked a flight at 12:35 from East London to Johannesburg as my onward flight is at 19:15.  Now I realize that they simply set my flight to depart at 6:15 p.m.  A call to the hotline revealed that I should pay R1207 to rebook. I did not make this booking.  Airlink claims there are no problems with the website, it's just strange that I'm not the only one who has the same problems.  I cannot recommend this airline. It's better to book through Safair than through Airlink, this airline is a rip-off.Es ist unglaublich, ich habe einen Flug gebucht um 12:35 von East London nach Johannesburg da mein Weiterflug um 19:15 geht. Jetzt stelle ich fest das sie meinen Flug einfach auf 18:15 Abflug gesetzt haben. Ein Anruf auf der Hotline hat ergeben das ich R1207 zahlen soll für eine umbuchung. Ich habe diese Buchung zu nicht getätigt! Airkink behauptet es gibt keine Problememit der Websit, nur komisch das ich nicht der einzige bin der die selben Probleme hat. Ich kann diese Airline nicht empfehle. Bucht lieber über safair als über Airlink, diese Airline ist abzocke."
Airlink,"✅Trip Verified| I recently had the opportunity to fly with Airlink South Africa for a short domestic flight. Although the itinerary was relatively brief, I was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. The booking process was straightforward and user-friendly, without any unnecessary complications or hidden fees. I appreciated the option to check in online and generate a boarding pass, saving time and effort at the airport. The staff at the check-in counter was friendly and efficient, guiding me through the process with a smile. I was delighted to board an Embraer 190 jet, a spacious and comfortable aircraft known for its exceptional legroom and modern amenities. The cabin felt roomy and airy, providing ample space to stretch out and enjoy the journey. The cabin crew was attentive and welcoming, ensuring that passengers were comfortable and well-served. Before takeoff, they offered a selection of boxed juices and small snacks, a nice touch for such a short flight. The crew's friendly demeanor and genuine care for passenger satisfaction were commendable. Although Airlink's fares may be slightly higher than some budget airlines, the overall experience justifies the additional cost. The airline offers a combination of comfort, efficiency, and friendly service that makes it a worthwhile choice for travelers seeking a pleasant air travel experience. My recent Airlink flight left me with a positive impression. The airline's commitment to efficiency, comfort, and customer service is evident in every aspect of the journey. While it may not be the cheapest option, Airlink South Africa delivers a value proposition worth considering for those seeking a reliable and enjoyable flying experience."
Airlink,"✅Trip Verified|  This was a connecting flight completing an overseas trip I had made to the USA; therefore, check in was performed at the desks at the international arrivals hall immediately after customs. I knew my check in luggage was slightly overweight (23 kg), but had already had been told by my travel agent that the flight was not looking like it was full. However, the check in lady informed me I was overweight, and I would have either reduce the contents of the suitcase or pay. After some 30 hours in the air, I was not about to do the former. She was completely implacable, and adopted a sarcastic attitude when I queried the severity of her decision - at that moment, I became angry, and left precipitously. The payment was only about R120, but was an irritation to get processed - the lady receiving payment was just as rude as the check-in clerk. In any event, the plane was less than half full, to the extent that the captain had to request people to move from the front to the back to obtain the correct balance. So, for the additional princely sum of R120, Airlink have lost a customer forever - there are competition airlines on this route."
Airnorth,"Not Verified| Horrible customer service, waited for an hour and they just hang up on me after a 2 minute conversation without resolving my problem with a refund. Call them again (after another hour of waiting time) and they hang up on me again when they felt too lazy to follow the conversation. I hope the worst future for this company and these people."
Airnorth,Not Verified|  Part way through the flight from Cairns I noticed that the seat belt had not been properly cleaned and a clump of chewing gum had been left on it by a previous passenger. Unfortunately the gum had by now stuck to my shorts. I reported this to the cabin crew but they said they could do nothing other than give me a small wet wipe sachet to try to clean my shorts and the remainder of the gum from the seat belt. There were spare seats available but none were offered as such I had no choice but to clean the belt or not use it. Not much choice there. I sent an email to Airnorth advising of my experience but have never received a response. A lack of customer care would seem to be endemic throughout the organization. Never again. Even if I have to pay more with another airline.
Airnorth,"Not Verified|  Horrible customer service, double charged and have now been unreachable and not returning any e-mails or calls for months. Pure garbage. The only way they are still operational is they have a monopoly on remote access."
Airnorth,"Not Verified|  Absolutely dreadful. These guys are terrible, they have zero care for customers. Flights cancelled without detail and no communication. This is a normal practice for them. Can't express my disgust with these guys, they have no consideration at all,"
Airnorth,"✅Trip Verified|  The only thing consistent about Airnorth is their inconsistency! I live in a town where it’s our only choice of airline so we have to continually endure rescheduled flights (I’m not talking about minutes behind, I mean hours and hours) You are forever missing connecting flights, losing money on motel rooms, rentals etc. Their pricing is typical of an airline who has a monopoly on a service, and I can live with that, but it’s the simple fact that they cannot provide a consistently reliable service for the money they get that infuriates me. And only providing a tiny bottle of water and a packet of cheese and crackers as in flight catering is poor. If you have the choice, never fly with this airline of inutility."
Airnorth,"Not Verified|  Had the worst experience with Air North whilst trying to get to Perth during the pandemic. Booked a flight with them from Darwin to Perth and never received any details of the flight confirmation in my inbox. Tried to call customer service and email several times and said the line had been disconnected. My card has been charged and I've now been trying to get the money back for this flight for about 3 months now. Still unresolved, still haven't managed to speak to a single person in customer service at Air North. Now being resolved with my bank."
Airnorth,"✅Trip Verified|  I am so impressed with Air North. The last time I flew with a different airline, I remember waiting ages for drink service that only came around once and paying something ridiculous for a small snack. But Air North blew that experience out of the water! Complimentary food and drinks are one thing, but this was only a 2.5 hour flight and they kept us busy the whole time serving drinks, a lovely sandwich, a cookie, and then more drinks. I was positively full at the end of the flight. And when I complimented the cookies (oatmeal chocolate chip served warm!) the very lovely stewardess, Keely, got me and my sister (my travelling companion) a few for the road!! She gave us good tips for visiting the Yukon, too. The airline was clean, flight was smooth and service was fantastic. I wish Air North flew everywhere - they would be my first choice every time."
Airnorth,"✅Trip Verified|  Flight changed twice from 5 and half hours to 8 hours and re routed from stop over in Townsville to Cairns with nearly three hour wait, then a trip into Gove before touching down in Darwin at 11.30 pm. I paid a descent fare to travel with a young child at reasonable time of day. This was a hell of a trip. Worst part is I couldn't ring to find out what was going on as no one would answer the phone. Disgusting service. I will no longer support the local airline once they have your money they don't give a toss."
Airnorth,"✅Trip Verified|  Totally unreliable and unprofessional service from Airnorth. Initial booking was rescheduled three times. Meaning I had to change hire car booking and appointments twice, the third charge I had to cancel as there was no time to organise accommodation. Rescheduled flight for the 9th of September. Plane has been delayed with no expected eta, no updates to passengers. As to why this has occurred. For a return flight time of two hours it has cost $1200, for this price we should get a decent meal on the plane. But $1200 we will a small packet of chips and a bottle of water. If only we had competition in the Northern Territory."
Airnorth,"✅Trip Verified|  Sydney to Kununurra . Thank you for the great service rendered by the flight crew for the flight that left Kununurra at 6pm to Darwin on the 23rd December,. All credit goes to them as it was the best smooth landing I have ever experienced."
AirSWIFT,"Not Verified|   My experience with Airswift has been a real disaster, our flight has been delayed twice, and as a result we have missed two flights. They don't give you complaint forms. Do not fly with this company."
AirSWIFT,"✅Trip Verified|  We bought a Coron Manila ticket and 2 nights before the flight, they changed destination to Clark, instead of Manila, as I had bought. Never received any notification for this. Clark is a 3-hour taxi ride from Manila. We then had a Manila Bangkok and then a Bangkok Dubai flight. We had left almost 5 hours of layover in Manila for greater security. The next day (about 18 hours before the flight), they informed us that not only had changed destination, but that the flight had been delayed by 2 hours, so we would no longer be able to take our connecting flight, so we had to buy another one. Manila Bangkok (USD1200 for 3 pax). The next day, the flight arrived in Coron 2 hours late, causing us to lose the new ticket (Usd1,200 to the trash). We finally had to buy a Manila Dubai (USD1300). Now AirSwift does not refund anything, because they say that flying the Coron-Clark, we accepted its flight. Obviously, there was no other alternative to leave Coron."
AirSWIFT,✅Trip Verified|  Pathetic excuse for an airline. Totally unreliable and unprofessional. Expect them to cancel or make massive changes to your reservation as soon as they have your money.
AirSWIFT,"Not Verified|  Cancelled our flight from El Nido to Bohol at a weeks notice but there are no other options for this journey so had to spend an afternoon of our holiday completely changing itineraries. Can’t get to Bohol now, lost money on hotel booking. Gave no reason for cancellation and no it’s not bad weather. Still haven’t refunded. Would never book again being so unreliable."
AirSWIFT,"✅Trip Verified|  They started by delaying the flight 3 hours. After everyone had checked in and the last flight from the airport left for the day, they cancelled the flight “due to weather”. Every other flight took off that day and there were other airlines flying to the same destination as this flight. They failed to reimburse costs for hotel room and car service to the airport. Next day the rescheduled flight was over an hour late. The fact that they lie to everyone about the reason for the cancel and take no responsibility for their incompetence has made it so I will never fly with them again. Take the ferry, it will save you time and a headache"
AirSWIFT,"Not Verified|  After I booked a flight from Manila to El Nido, I read a slew of bad reviews regarding last minute cancellations that are common with this airline. And that was concerning to me, but what could I do at that point? Sure as heck, 24 hours before my flight from Manila was supposed to depart, I received an email from Airswift saying my flight was cancelled due to maintenance issues as well. If you choose to go to Palawan, I would choose any other airline than AirSWIFT even if it means a long bus ride to El Nido."
AirSWIFT,"✅Trip Verified|  Caticlan to El Nido in ATR 42-600. They rolled a carpet from to the plane to enter and exit. Good service in flight, on time flight and greeted with umbrellas from the plane to the arrival hall of the airport to avoid the hot sun in El Nido. 10 plus for this flight."
AirSWIFT,"✅Trip Verified|  Manila to El Nido. AirSWIFT is a Philippine boutique airline offering daily roundtrip flights from Manila to El Nido. And this is the only way to go to El Nido. If you book any property of the El Nido Resorts, you would get a discount on its flight. And there is also a VIP lounge for guests of El Nido Resorts in the airport. They fly AT4, a very old plane. Do not expect to have much service in this short one hour ride. Of course also no any entertainment. But the crews and ground staff are friendly."
AJet,"✅Trip Verified|   Would not recommend it to anyone. They lost our suitcase and for one month there were no updates. After one month they called to notify us that they found the suitcase. They pretended like that nothing is wrong, unbelievable. Worst experience ever."
AJet,"✅Trip Verified| Never fly with this irresponsible airline. I am a travel agent and unfortunately I had to book many tickets with this new unprofessional Airline. 90% of their flights get canceled or delayed, and no one is responsible either in the call centre or any office (they don't have offices in most of countries)."
AJet,"✅Trip Verified| I was looking on Turkish Airlines' website for a return flight from Istanbul to Diyarbakir. The outward flight at the time I wanted was on Ajet. Although shown in the Turkish Airlines' computer, it made me go to Ajet site to book. So I did that and then came back to Turkish Airlines to book my return ticket. Entering the aircraft was like stepping back in time. Old fashioned ceiling and wall panels, small luggage bins, no video screens. After take-off there was a line of people waiting for the toilet until the crew realized it had been locked during departure, but had not been unlocked after take-off. A Turkish Airlines cart was brought through the cabin from which cold snacks and soft drinks were available for sale. I bought a sandwich and drink. One bite of the sandwich told it was cold, dry and stodgy. I looked inside and as you can see in the photo there was a miniscule amount of butter (maybe not even butter) on both sides of the bread. It was undoubtedly the worst catering I have had from Turkish Airlines in 27 years flying on them. Later I saw what were obviously hot crew meal entrees being taken to the rear galley. I hope they at least had something good to eat! Adding the cost of my sandwich and drink, I paid more on Ajet than for my flight back on Turkish Airlines. The crew were polite, with a few smiles. One of the crew 'uniforms' was navy blue and green, another all red and a third all grey. I only saw three of the crew. The recorded announcements were clear and understandable, but live ones were at double speed and mostly unintelligible. Credit where credit is due, the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. I had worried about this when I saw that the preceding Tehran flight on the same aircraft was over nine hours delayed. Will I fly Ajet again? Probably not unless there is no other option."
AJet,"✅Trip Verified|   My ADB/SAW flight which was made on AJet July 18, was changed much earlier than notified to me (at the new time is 10:25 in the morning (16:10).) When I arrived at the airport because the agency approved it without notifying me, I naturally applied to the AJet sales office because my flight has already left. I cannot use my SAW/DXB flight because the sales office did not notify me of the change made by the agency. I can't make free changes and the first SAW/DXB flight is on 05.08.2024. I lost my money and my work"
AJet,"Not Verified|   My experience was very smooth, no flight changes or surprises in the departure flight. In the arrival flight there was a security threat in Beirut Airport resulting in flight delays for ALL airlines. The way Ajet dealt with the situation was outstanding and professional. Given the unintended delays, we missed the next flight. Without even asking and as soon as we arrived to their desk, they fixed the flight for the next day and offered us free transport, hotel, and meals. The air and ground crew is very nice and helpful. The only setback is in communicating with the Airport employees in English. Until this improves, communicate with a smile and nice attitude, and you'll get what you want eventually."
Akasa Air,"Not Verified|  I didn't know they are going to be so cheap in cooperative with 1-2kgs of extra luggage. They kept asking 1200 rs, that female staff was unreasonable. In the flight, I asked I want to use loo, the female attendant told wait sometime, didn't bother to ask again, I kept looking for them then pressed the button. Thirdly, when they told they would take cash for meal, they were not even asking every seat row if someone needs to order something or if someone needs a cup of water (don't know if they even had free cup of water or not?). Egoistic staff everywhere is what I faced and courtesy to ask back for anything."
Akasa Air,✅Trip Verified| Worst experience with ground staff at the counter. They have been very rude and difficult to deal with. I wish I had never flown Akasa Air. The flight departure was also late and there is no information neither by messages or phone call. Worst staff in airline industry.
Akasa Air,"Not Verified|  Never book a flight with this airline, especially if you need to travel with your pet. I booked a flight and sent them a confirmation email for my cat, but they informed me that I made a mistake by booking it before getting the confirmation. They said they didn't have a slot available for my pet on that day. I agreed to reschedule on a day when a pet slot was available, but then they realized that the photo of the pet carrier I provided wouldn't work because I had given them an Amazon description and a screenshot of the bag link. I had ordered the bag but it hadn't been delivered yet. They asked me to wait until the bag was delivered so that I could measure it with my hand and a measuring tape and send them a picture. They claimed that the dimensions mentioned in the description might be different from the actual dimensions of the bag. Despite all the inconvenience, I agreed to wait for my bag to be delivered. Now, when I asked them to reschedule my ticket for the day when a pet slot is available, they asked for an extra 12k for rescheduling. This means that in addition to the approximately 11k I already paid for my previous ticket, I have to pay an additional 12k for rescheduling and 7500 for my cat. So, instead of the original ticket price of 11k, they are charging me a total of 30k including the cost for my pet. I also want to mention the rude behavior of all the agents. They spoke to me like robots and lacked any customer service skills."
Akasa Air,"✅Trip Verified|   They delivered a broken suitcase, which was checked in. The ground staff not so much helpful and made me wait long hours On top that, they refused to provide a claiming form or go ahead with the refund claiming process"
Akasa Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Absolutely the worst experience! This is my second time flying with this airline, and both times they’ve managed to mess something up. The staff lacks basic courtesy and has no idea how to communicate with passengers. The ground staff have a condescending attitude. Last time, while traveling from Bangalore to Mumbai, the flight was delayed by 3 hours, and they didn’t even bother informing passengers. This time, while traveling from Mopa International to Bangalore, the team was incredibly rude at the check-in counter."
Akasa Air,✅Trip Verified|   Highly unreliable airline. Cancelled flight last minute and they called before 4 hrs to say it is cancelled. Extremely disappointed with this airlines.
Akasa Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Totally unreliable, unapologetic airline. They share an one liner email at 1 AM in the morning informing flight cancellations for a morning flight scheduled on that day. No other communication, no alternate flight arrangements. When called up their customer care, these shameless guys informs we have another flight next day, but you have to pay the balance, wow. Absolutely third class airline, avoid as much as possible."
Akasa Air,Not Verified| Delayed by 2.20 hours. Slow airline and slow staff. Always delayed and worst staff and behaviour. Highly cheap way of operating and extremely disappointing and unprofessional.
Akasa Air,"Not Verified|  The worst aircraft service ever. Starting from ticket counter, all the staff member were really rude with us. The flight was initially cancelled by Akasa’s side and then they arranged an alternate flight which was again delayed by 4hrs. Highly recommend to spend some extra bucks but go with any other airlines but not Akasa."
Akasa Air,"Not Verified| I was supposed to fly at 10:50 AM today, but flight rescheduled to 3:30 PM, and I only received the message at 6:00 AM. We planned our entire day, and now it's all wasted—hotel, cab expenses, and our entire itinerary ruined. When we asked for rescheduling early or compensation, team refused and only offered cancellation. When I have reached the airport flight again delayed by 25 minutes. Very disappointed"
Alaska Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   I recently flew from Maui to San Francisco, and unfortunately, my experience was incredibly disappointing. The flight itself was a routine 4-hour trip, but midway through, I had boiling water spilled on me by a flight attendant. The burn caused significant pain, and I had to endure the rest of the flight in excruciating discomfort. What made this experience even worse was the complete lack of care or follow-up from the airline. Not only did I receive no apology, but I wasn’t offered any form of compensation, assistance, or even acknowledgment of the incident. To make matters worse, I was not refunded for the flight, despite the severe pain I endured. Flying should be a safe and comfortable experience, but unfortunately, this flight left me feeling ignored and mistreated. I sincerely hope the airline takes this seriously and improves their customer care and safety protocols in the future."
Alaska Airlines,"Not Verified| Our inbound flight from Seattle was delayed almost 30 minutes, we pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. When we landed in Seattle we were told that we would be able to make our very tight connecting flight without issue. We made it to the connecting gate at 15:38- notably before the 15:40 scheduled departure of our flight to Missoula. Unfortunately our gate was already closed and we were informed the next flight was six hours later. The staff were all unfriendly, putting us in a loop of people deflecting the blame to the next people and leaving us without any options. We asked for any sort of compensation for the entire day they have wasted but were told there was nothing anyone could do. I genuinely pray that I never have to fly this airline again. T"
Alaska Airlines,"Not Verified|  The service on the flights is great. Free movies and texting. Pay for full wifi. The flight crew we're very friendly. However, our luggage was lost/delayed during our 11.25 hour overnight layover in Seattle. The Seattle-Tacoma Airport had issues with their sorting systems, but with so much time between flights and it being an overnight layover, the lost/delayed luggage seems rather unacceptable. Compensation was not offered upon arrival at our final destination until I asked about it. The airline sent an email telling us about the issues at the Seattle airport, 6 hours after we had already checked our bags and were enroute to Seattle. Extremely disappointed in the handling of our belongings which included gifts purchased while on vacation and medications."
Alaska Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   The worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. We were set to fly out at 9am and we got notified around 4am our flight was canceled, not delayed, fully canceled. We immediately called customer support and it was a 4 hour wait. We got a call back around 11am and they said there are no other flights going out and they were not sure when another one would go out to Seattle. We tried later in the evening to check if any flights were available and there were a few but all $500+ per ticket (triple what we paid) and had a full day layover. We would waste half our trip trying to just catch a flight out. We had no other option but to cancel the entire trip and try to get refunds. Within their contract they are responsible to put us on the next outgoing flight and they failed to do so. Support was not any help and often rude about the situation. We’re still waiting on our refund from the airline and still trying to get a refund from our hotel we booked too."
Alaska Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| I had a bad experience on the airplane. The seat is uncomfortable it can’t be adjusted, lavatory is dirty and stinky. The crews are unhelpful, comparing to other airlines, this airline is not worth paying at all."
Alaska Airlines,"Not Verified|   Worst experience ever accompanied by the highest negligence. Tried to take a weekend vacation and it was absolutely destroyed by this company. They put the wrong gate and destination name was reversed to what was on the board. I was sent to the other side of the airport to a gate they didn’t use that took a half hour dragging luggage, then running back with it after it was determined that they printed the wrong gate on the ticket. Name on the ticket for the destination was San Lucas Cabo while on the board was Los Cabo as you can imagine not under C nor S. Missed the flight and their customer service rep couldn’t help herself but to continue raising her voice although I reminded numerous times to lower it and keep it leveled with mine, after all she wasn’t the one that missed her flight and had to run around the airport. Charged me to rebook the flight the next day, wouldn’t cover or compensate hotel nor car rides for being stuck in a different city. Then found out that they had misspelled my name on the rebooked ticket that took over an hour on the phone to fix. But the fun didn’t stop there, while I had paid for premium that included checking bags, they didn’t have the same level the next day but while not willing to refund the difference even, charged a me for checking in the bag. Still not done with their shenanigans, the next day, after we waited in line to go through security, once we made it there, the flight they had assigned to my wife’s passport was different than the one showing on the app so couldn’t go through, had to get out of the line and go wait on the checking bag line to get it fixed then go back to the security line to go through. Proof of the ticket and events were provided to their customer service and a week after supposed review, they admitted the fault and their offer was $250 credit towards the next flight with them, my tickets were over $2,000 for both of us. You couldn’t pay me enough to fly with this company. If this is the last choice to fly, I’m staying home."
Alaska Airlines,Not Verified|   I had a horrible experience with this airline. The seats were pretty standard and the legroom was very tight. The were not that friendly either. I would never fly this airline again
Alaska Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| One of the airline employees at check-in was rude and TRIPLE charged me for my suitcase. She made 2 of the charges under bogus flight codes so Alaska Airlines employees “can’t find” the charges to cancel them. They blame my bank and take no responsibility for their own incompetent employees. So basically, I was overcharged $200 (billed $300 for 1 bag which should’ve been $100). If you must fly Alaska, be prepared for huge unnecessary bills and rude employees."
Alaska Airlines,"Not Verified|   My wife just returned from a conference in Nashville using Alaska Airlines #1269. Alaska used to be a much better airline as far as service, cleanliness and simple amenities. Her flight had a filthy bathroom (sometmes that happens) and one that had not been cleaned well for a LONG time. When you enter the bathroom and there is mold around the switches and sliders and mold on some of the contact surfaces you know that this plane had not a had a decent cleaning for many days or months. We used to prefer Alaska but lately we look for JetBlue, Delta and SW itineraries first."
Alaska Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  We experienced 2 delays with the total just under 3 hours. We weren’t notified a single time. Denied lounge access as they had changed their policy after we had already booked our first class tickets with the intention of using the lounge. No meal vouchers offered during prolonged delay. Once on board our seats were dirty and not sanitised according to covid standards. Seats were covered in crumbs from past passenger, menus were torn and covered in food. Staff could not confirm if our special order meals were dairy free even though we had specially selected them for allergy reason. There was no access to entertainment and this could not be troubleshot. Our bags were not placed as priority so we were even later for the commitment we were attending. Customer service were very unhelpful and unsympathetic. They offered us a future discount code but we are not from America so it is of no use to us. We would not use this. I offered to be reimbursed with partnership flight miles to which they declined. Do your future self a favour and avoid this airline at all costs."
Alitalia,"Not Verified| This was probably one of the worst experiences I ever had with an airline. I arrived at the Rome airport with a 3 hour layover which I spent mostly waiting on a line to get my boarding pass even though I checked in online many hours before. Boarding the plane was so disorganized it was painful. The plane was dirty, very dirty. The staff was so nasty and the food was deplorable. There was nothing cold to drink and the cabin was hot. My wife has severe breathing issues. We asked several times to do something about the lack of air with no success. This flight was a 9-hour nightmare for my wife. Flight 610 from Rome to New York was a disaster. I never fly with this airline."
Alitalia,"✅Trip Verified| This airline is indeed a disgrace in the airline industry. I had the worst travel experience of my life in Italy. Upon arrival in Rome, we waited for 2 hours at the baggage claim area, no one did ever inform us that this airline had a strike and no one knows where our luggage was. We had to spend another 2 hours lining up at the customer service to fill out a claim form and we were told that someone will call us when they find our luggage. Ergo, we left the airline empty handed. 3 days had passed, no calls and no one was available to pick up our calls, we decided to go back to the airport. Hundreds of pieces of luggage were everywhere, anyone could freely get any luggage as no one was monitoring it. We only found one of the luggage and the other one went missing. We reported our missing bag via email since as we don't have time to line up for another couple of hours to declare our missing bag as we were headed to our our next destination. Only to be told that they are not responsible for our missing luggage, that it is our responsibility to report it to the police. We were really shocked on how these people handle this situation - as if they are really used to this kind of situation. Their defense is ignore complaints or concerns like there's nothing wrong. The missing bag is not fault of our own! Their crew went on strike, their passengers are innocent with what's going on with their company. It's not fair that they dragged us with their misery and screw up our holiday just like that. As soon as I came back home after our vacation, I immediately called their customer service, their agents were just hanging up on me whenever they hear the purpose of my call. This is truly unbelievable! Until now, no one hasn't gotten back to us about the status of our missing luggage."
Alitalia,"✅Trip Verified| A terrible experience. A disgrace. From the wifi not working (not as advertised) to the lack of service on flight (for over 9 hours we were left without drinks, no juices nor any other drink was served except for water that you had to get up and go ask for) to the 2 hostesses at the check-in making sexist comments about my husband being 20 years older than me. They literally gossiped in my face in Italian while checking my documents unaware that I speak Italian too. Needless to say, this happens only with Alitalia!"
Alitalia,"Not Verified|  Will never fly Alitalia again - first they send me a message to check in and two hours later they email me to say the flight was cancelled. Not even 24 hours before the scheduled flight. They provided no alternative flights, only a request for reimbursement. Who knows how long that will take to finalize, in the meantime I'm at a resort scrambling to reschedule it for the same day with Alitalia - I find a flight out (not easy to do when you're on the island of Cagliari, and Alitalia is the only airline servicing Cagliari from Fiumicino airport in Rome) and pay for that one too, have to make it a round trip because the website doesn't per me choose just one-way. So I get that confirmation by email and think crisis averted, but 15 minutes later I receive another email from Alitalia cancelling that reservation too! I go online to see what is going on with the company, and apparently they're planning to strike two days after my scheduled flight. I call both customer service numbers and they don't answer, then the call gets disconnected, what utter hell they put their customers through without so much as an explanation, or a flight alternative! Never again will I use them, horrible example to set as a company."
Alitalia,"Not Verified|  I’ve never seen such a bad company. Rude people. No service at all. They lost my luggage. Well it has been on ""delivery"" for the last 2 days…. Terrible choice"
Alitalia,"Not Verified|  Worst airline experience of my life. Alitalia workers were on strike when we landed in Rome from Olbia, Sardinia, and no one had bothered to tell passengers before we checked our bags to embark. We were told we could not have our luggage back due to the strike, and that it would be sitting on the tarmac for days. We had a flight home to Toronto the following day and did not have days to wait for our luggage. The staff was incredibly rude and unconcerned with the situation they had imposed on their customers. We have ZERO faith we will ever see our luggage again, which almost a week later is still sitting at Fiumicino airport with no response from Alitalia to my emailed inquiries about when we will have them returned to us or receive reimbursement for the lost items.  They are chaotic, rude, and will not be accountable for any costs they impose on you."
Alitalia,"Not Verified|  Worst customer service ever! First they canceled our flight (no email to let us know ahead of time) they let us know when we were in the airport, Gladly we could change our flight, I saw a customer service not using a mask during a pandemic, they never asked us for COVID test during a pandemic, my passport last name and my married last were not the same and they made a huge deal about it and they would not let us get in the plane until I show a marriage certificate. Let alone I needed help and all the stuff and customer service looked at me like they don’t work there and pretty stressful experience."
Alitalia,"✅Trip Verified|  We flew from Brindisi to Rome, service was trash everyone there is on a power trip, no customer service skills at all. Very rude. Then Rome to NY, the flight was fine, but they didn't pay Delta for our connecting flight to Atlanta. Delta found our name in the system but said the spots were only reserved and basically Alitalia owed them money, to actually book the flight. We didn’t find this out till we got to NY because none of the service desks/ppl at the gate were able to print us our ticket in Rome or brindisi and didn’t say why. So we get to NY Find this out and end up missing our flight. We’re still on the phone with the airline on hold to get this sorted out. I’m very disappointed with my overall experience with this airline. Unreliable airline and rude people working for them. These are only the issues we had on the way back home to ATL. We had issues otw to Rome too- again rude staff and terrible customer service."
Alitalia,"Not Verified|  This is the worst airline ever! Starting with a website that is sooo Not user friendly. To the extremely rude and unprofessional staff on the phone and in the airport. Nothing like waiting to check in and only 2 people working the counter while 6 people stand around talking to one another’s door there’s about 60 people on line. Lazy doesn’t even cover how these people acted! The food on the plane was awful! You could only have water to drink - the food was served prison style. No one smiled or even pretended to be happy, you felt like they were doing you a favor just being there. They picked up the trays of uneaten food and that was the last you saw of these miserable people. I did ask why they weren’t serving and soft drinks I was told it was due to COVID restrictions which I found out was false. The inflight entertainment was a joke 9 hours of flying with movies from 1990. Never again will I fly Alitalia."
Alitalia,"Not Verified|  Very bad airline, I cancelled my trip in June 2020, they gave me a voucher to use in Europe only and never told me I had it, it only lasted for 6 months then it expired. I found out myself when I called. I couldn't use the voucher credit as travel in Australia is banned and we are in Lockdown. They wouldn't extend but can apply refund only for the tax part of the ticket. So I lost all the money for my ticket. Can only get a tiny bit back. But when I call them in Italy they are very rude they hang up when I asked them to repeat what they said.  Very rude and not helpful and greedy to keep peoples money. Absolutely horrible. Will never book with them again."
Allegiant Air,"Not Verified|  I have a flight today that departs at 12:54pm. I was planning on adding my two bags under the airplane early this morning due to getting paid today. The allegiant app checked me in automatically, which means I am unable to check in my bags for the price of $50. I would have to check them in at the airport which will be $75 per bag. Now you would think that you would be able to get in contact with allegiant 24/7 customer service. Nope, no one answers. I have been sitting on the phone since 4:00 this morning. I wonder how many people had to be charged extra do to this issue. Allegiant should not be giving false information about their 24/7 customer service when they actually do not  have a 24/7 customer service rep answering customers calls. And this issue with the app automatically checking people in is outrageous. I will never fly Allegiant again."
Allegiant Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Could not check in (in Albany) because they were still checking in another flight. Unable to check in more than one flight at a time led to long lines and frustrated customers. Also, when we landed in St Petersburg (PIE) it took over an hour for our bags to come out. Absolutely unacceptable. I would only recommend this airline for select routes."
Allegiant Air,Not Verified| There was a carry on luggage bag size issue. I really didn't know that the size is not correct (which I'm still not sure) because when I checked it's dimensions on the scale it looks ok but the attendent told me that the size is bigger just by 1-2 inches. However I got charged twice for one luggage and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE failed to refund me. They were just telling their terms and conditions bla bla. I am fully disappointed.
Allegiant Air,"Not Verified|   After delaying our 6:20 flight three times, we got to the airport and received a text that the flight was canceled and rescheduled for 2:30 the following afternoon. They offered us $175 back plus a $100 flight voucher. Does not cover the hundreds of dollars lost for a car rental and Airbnb for the night plus missing an entire day of our vacation."
Allegiant Air,"Not Verified|  Linda from Allegiant flight 2598 on August 8th, 2024 at 7:11 pm, was great. She helped me when I got sick on the way to Florida from Syracuse. I was so sick and she gave me a trash bag and took care of it. And no judgement."
Allegiant Air,"Not Verified|  On August 4, 2024, I was scheduled to return home to Virginia from Austin, Texas, on Allegiant Air flight 1516. Since it was a 2:34 PM flight, I arrived at the airport with my two daughters and my 78-year-old mother two hours early to check in and wait. Starting around 1:40 PM, boarding was repeatedly delayed due to various issues, and eventually, we were informed that the plane needed to fly to Houston for refueling. (Delays due to refueling are a very frequent occurrence with this airline!) Since my children had their school orientation the next day, it was crucial for us to get home. Despite several delay announcements, we waited at the airport for over 7 hours before being told that the flight was canceled due to weather. The weather in Austin at the time of departure was clear, and there were no issues at the destination. We were told it was due to Tropical Storm Debbie, but I learned that if the flight had departed on time, it would have been unaffected. The airline’s response was disappointing and outrageous. The ground staff shirked responsibility, directing us to call the service center to reschedule or request a refund, offering only a flight on Thursday or a refund. After 7 hours of waiting and growing frustration, I protested but was threatened with being removed from the airport by security, seemingly because of my Asian descent. We were eventually forced to leave the airport and had to contact relatives in Austin to pick us up. Desperate to get home, I persisted in contacting the service center. After three lengthy calls and an hour-and-a-half wait, I finally spoke with a representative who offered the same irresponsible options I had faced at the airport: “The earliest flight is on Sunday, or we can offer a full refund.” Are you saying the next available flight is on Sunday, August 11th? What about the additional lodging and travel expenses? Am I expected to cancel a flight I booked months in advance at a low price and find a last-minute, expensive one-way ticket? This is unreasonable. I demanded the quickest option to get close to home and refused to hang up. As a result, I was offered a flight to Pittsburgh at 6:30 AM the next day. I accepted and rented a car to drive approximately 190 miles home. Due to the airline’s refusal to take responsibility, I endured two days of delays and confusion at the airport and incurred additional costs, including $500 for the rental car."
Allegiant Air,"Not Verified|  I had an extremely disappointing experience with Allegiant Air that felt nothing short of a scam. My flight 1233 from Minot International (MOT) to Orlando Sanford International (SFB), scheduled to depart on Monday, 05 August 2024 at 5:43 PM, was delayed to 12:30 PM on Tuesday, 06 August 2024. This last-minute rescheduling caused me significant financial loss and inconvenience. As a self-employed professional, I rely on timely travel to manage my business commitments. The delay resulted in a full day’s lost earnings and additional expenses for accommodation, meals, and transportation. Despite their claims of prioritizing passenger safety, Allegiant Air showed no regard for the financial and personal impact their delays cause. To make matters worse, when I reached out to Allegiant for compensation, their response was dismissive and inadequate. This level of customer neglect and mismanagement is unacceptable, and I feel cheated by their false promises.  I will certainly be taking my business elsewhere and advise others to do the same."
Allegiant Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Delayed 3 hours to get another plane. Overbooked flight while they begged for passengers to voluntarily reschedule. Landed at 7:54 pm should have been 4:47pm. After we landed it was lightning so when we were cleared there was no one to taxi in plane  By the time they got someone it was lightening again  So now currently still sitting here for an hour and a half on the runway. They said if we sit for 30 more minutes we get complimentary water and pretzels. I don’t want, I want off this plane."
Allegiant Air,"Not Verified|   Seriously, with the technical advances we have, they can't figure out how to make their phone hold times less? They can't figure out the logistics of seat assignments for different planes? They can't make refunds automatic when they have to change seats for their customers. I paid for front row seats months in advance and they can't refund me without a 45 minute hold time when they took those seats away? It's worth more money to fly another airline than to deal with their service."
Allegiant Air,"✅Trip Verified|  During our recent flight from Myrtle Beach to Rickenbacker, the overall experience was satisfactory. The flight proceeded smoothly, with a seamless takeoff, landing, and minimal turbulence. Onboard, we had a team of four flight attendants, three of whom carried out their duties effectively. However, one of the attendants exhibited concerning behavior. She displayed signs that suggested she may have been under the influence of some substance, as her actions appeared erratic and unusual. Additionally, we overheard her speaking in a sharp tone, expressing frustration regarding passengers fastening their seat belts and storing their luggage. Throughout the duration of the flight, she maintained a displeased expression, causing several passengers to comment on her apparent state."
Alliance Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Excellent flight, left on time and arrived on time (Amritsar to Kullu). Small aircraft which was about 2/3 full. Great price - no complaints from me and would happily fly with them again."
Alliance Air,"Not Verified| The airline unexpectedly cancelled the flight without any prior information. This not only caused inconvenience but further financial loss as we had to cancel our trip to Shimla last minute. However, the money that was already paid for hotel booking by then had become non-refundable. Will never recommend this airline to anyone. If they cannot ensure reliable operations, this shows there lack of professionalism and quality. It is really not worth it to waste your precious time and planning in order to save a few hundered rupees on their tickets. It seems more like a scam than anything."
Alliance Air,Not Verified|   This flight has some bad history of cancelling. Our flight got cancelled at last movement. Our relatives had to book another at high cost from Bangalore to Vijayawada. I booked for 19 Apr 24 marriage; as it was cheaper based on checking the history that it might not repeat again as it was only once cancelled in last month. But had a nightmare; i was in call with family till takeoff hoping we are good. Soon about 15 minutes of takeoff Captain announce technical problem in midair and will be returning back to Bangalore. Also asked to hold your children. But luckily we landed safely. The coordinator said will arrange the flight at 10.30 am. When we asked again; said its same flight upon repair; then in 30 mins; again another information that the flight is not suitable and hence cancelling for the day. So the same flight is repaired and lifted every day. If there was such problem in this old ATR700 aricraft they should have grounded it.
Alliance Air,"✅Trip Verified|  I had the misfortune of booking my mother's first-ever flight journey with this airline, and it was an absolute disaster from start to finish. Despite her excitement and anticipation, the flight ended up being cancelled after an excruciatingly long wait. The sheer disappointment and frustration she experienced cannot be overstated. The complete lack of organization and communication from the airline only added insult to injury. I wouldn't wish this dreadful experience on my worst enemy, let alone someone I care about. Absolutely appalling service."
Alliance Air,"✅Trip Verified|  It was the worst flight ever I used in my 17 years of air travel. No proper maintenance and no backup plan. In fact no proper information. Right after the flight took off from Benguluru, we noticed a free fall for few seconds. Then the Pilot took u turn and was able to land back in Benguluru. After land only pilot communicated all passenger that the engine #2 is not working. The communication from the airline is very bad, there were just mentioning they dont know what is going to happen no answer/decisions made and we had sit in the aircraft for an hour, and put on a bus for an hour then unloaded at airport. After that they said no backup flight, no alternate plan. They did mention we will get refund but we need to call their customer service for the refund."
Alliance Air,Not Verified| Worst airline ever. Our round trip flights got cancelled just like that - they don't care to explain the reason. We are traveling with an infant and we faced lot of problems with refund. Our trip cost a lot more because of this.
Alliance Air,✅Trip Verified|  They first mention the flight as delayed after reaching airport and waiting for one hour so i left to my house taking a confirmation that they will inform me about the next flight and then send a text saying flight will leave at 12:50. Called customer care to confirm and two of their representatives confirm that the flight will leave at 12:50 pm. I reach airport at 11:50 AM and entry staff tell me flight is cancelled and i receive a message from the airline at 12 pm. They have zero coordination and who informs customers about flight cancellation 50 minutes before departure? I had to travel to and fro from airport 6 times today.
Alliance Air,Not Verified| Pathetic Service by Alliance Air. Please guys never book a flight with this airline - call center and onground intimations are absolutely pathetic. Flight delays of more than 3 hours.
Alliance Air,Not Verified| Travel on this airline only if you have nothing else to do or unlimited time. Always delayed. No information regarding arrival/departure. Cabin crew-employed to chat with one another and other staff members travelling on the plane. Toilets with no water.
Alliance Air,"Not Verified| This is the first time that I have traveled on such a poor flight. I will never travel on this flight again. As the flight begins, the first news comes that the engine has broken down and all passengers are evacuated. Exactly 20 minutes later, news comes that the engine has been repaired. Again the passengers are told that the flight is not starting due to engine failure. This was a very bad flight, will never travel on it."
Alliance Airlines,"Not Verified|   They often cancel flights at the last moment, and when asked for a reason, the management provides unsatisfactory responses. They also claim that, at the time of booking, they clearly mention that the airline has the right to cancel the flight at any moment. Make sure to have an alternate travel option other than this airline. I believe they operate like corporate scammers, holding our money and using it for 20-30 days without any interest. Please choose another airline for your travels. My flight was 9I-695 from Udaipur to Ahmedabad, scheduled for travel on 29-07-2024."
Alliance Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I have just flown alliance from Brisbane to Gladstone. The cabin crew did not smile, hardly spoke to any of the passengers and once in the air offered a glass of water in the first 10 minutes after takeoff and then both stood in the galley talking and not once walked down the aisle to see if any of the passengers needed anything. On disembarking at Gladstone they both stood in the galley with their backs to the passengers and never spoke to one passenger. The customer service was poor to nonexistent with very cramped seating. We will not fly with alliance again."
Alliance Airlines,"Not Verified|  Today we flew on VA367 Brisbane to Townsville. I usually fly Jetstar as it suits my time requirements. This flight was perfect, the seats were much more comfortable and the staff were the best I have experienced, they could not have been more helpful. I could not fault Alliance in any way and I would always be happy with them . We had just flown from Perth and we were both pretty tired so thankyou so much."
Alliance Airlines,"Not Verified|  Seating comfort is very poor. The business management of this airlines is very poor, because majority of seats are vacant. Simply increasing the fare daily. If the fare was law, 10 of my friends would have booked this flight instead of bus from Hyderabad to Mysore. Considering the standard of the flight, if the fare decrease the airlines may get more passengers. If the passengers are not sufficient, the management should decrease the fare the same day of flying and in that case it is better to have bargaining platform."
Alliance Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| In booking this flight, there is no way to purchase more than 15kg per checked in bag on the website. Then when you arrive to check in I was promptly charged an extortionate amount for the excess weight. The ground staff were completely inflexible and only concerned about getting as much money from unsuspecting passengers as possible. The service on the plane was non-existent and I would avoid this airline at all costs."
Alliance Airlines,✅Trip Verified| I am not able to do web check in and their customer care number is on hold for like an hour! Why should I face consequences due to their negligent behaviour. Booking for the first time and such a bad experience! Won’t regret writing this review! Please people don’t waste your time and money on this flight. Book other flights.
Alliance Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| The airplane was supposed to take off at 15.35 but we flew late. During the entire journey the arc’s in the cabin were not working, with such hot weather outside and no AC in the cabin all the passengers were agitated and were sweating. The air hostess did not care and kept saying that it will work in 15-20min. The air hostesses were rude and busy in their own gossiping. Worst flight ever."
Alliance Airlines,"Not Verified|  Port Macquarie to Brisbane. Dreadful. The age of the plane is ok, however the claustrophobic set up of the cabin is dreadful. The seats were small. We are average sized and were wondering how we were going to fit into the chairs. I have a chronic pain condition and within 20 minutes I was beside myself with being cramped into such a small place. No knee room, no room to reach anything in your handbag on the floor, barely can you put your tray table down. The water and white bread half sandwich was pretty random, not even a cup of tea. How on earth you fit so many overweight people in those seats is beyond me. What happens when large people book 1 seat? Which is the size of half a normal seat?"
Alliance Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Gladstone to Brisbane. I booked this flight through Virgin Australia website. But later I found out that Virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called Alliance Airlines. The aircraft was a Fokker 70 with old interior look. The legroom was very tight. The airline's magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadn't been prepared tastefully. On the positive side, the crew were the most friendly cabin crew I've seen in Australian airlines. The complimentary snack (it was a 7:30am flight) was better than what Virgin used to offer. However, the only drink available was water. It is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning, at least they can sell a few options on board. The flight time was shorter than usual as it wasn't a propeller aircraft. Handling at both airport was done by Virgin Australia so it wasn't really related to this review. Generally, it's good that a new competitor is entering the market. As a beginner in this sector, they seem to be doing acceptable job. But they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional Australia."
Amaszonas,"✅Trip Verified|  I traveled to La Paz, Bolivia from Paraguay and before mentioning the real problem, they already changed the flight schedule couple times that even doesn't have the time for transfer. I contacted the Amaszonas airline thousands of times and eventually, (and hard) I could change the reasonable time. But the real problem was on coming back travel. The flight attendant from Amaszonas requested the yellow fever vaccinate card of hard copy. I already showed the soft copy of it to the airport and the counter of Amaszonas and there wasn't any problem. But before taking the flight, the attendant asked me the hard copy card and I said her that I already got approved it and they didn't mention anything about it. But she didn't listen it and just made me stand in the corridor for 30 mins and she didn't measure anything. 30 mins later, she just said to me to enter the gate without any explanation or excuse. Maybe it's the reason that I'm the only foreigner among the passengers. I had a joyful time in Bolivia but because of this, I have a bad memory for this flight and even for the country. If you want to experience unpleasant journey, take this airline."
Amaszonas,"✅Trip Verified|  First time flying with this airline. All in all I've heard positive remarks about them so I've been wanting to take a flight with them. Not much I can say as they did their job properly. Ground and onboard service was fine. As it's a regional airline, I think all of their planes are small sized (i.e. Embraer). The only comment I have about their comapny site. It wasn't easy to buy a ticket there, so I ended up buying it from an agent."
Amaszonas,"✅Trip Verified| Small plane E190 it was, but everything moved along efficiently. Decent legroom, nothing to rave nor complain about, but more importantly the boarding process was seamless and so was the disembarking process. Baggage arrived with zero issues. Worthwhile noting that tickets were expensive though. Despite all the negative reviews here, it's one of the only options from La Paz to Uyuni other than the Todo Turismo tourist bus (which we took on the way back and was pretty decent as well), so where flights are concerned, just cross your fingers and hope for the best. Do not be afraid after reading all the negativity here. Not all is bad."
Amaszonas,"Not Verified|  Santa Cruz to Asuncion. I had an international ticket that said “snack”. The snack was food for sale. The airline will not even give you water on their planes. Planes are very old, smelly and dirty and the staff was trying to do their best but were not specially kind or efficient. Seats are very small (two per side, per row) with very little space."
Amaszonas,"✅Trip Verified|  La Paz to Uyuni. Due to weather issues the airline understandably cancelled our flight to Uyuni, upon learning that rebooking was not an option due to tour constraints we were assured we would be reimbursed and provided the link to give our information. That was June, and in November we still have not received the reimbursement much less any information about it. Despite filling out the paperwork multiple times and sending followup inquiries, they are incredibly unresponsive and have not provided any indication that we will ever see this reimbursement. If you book this airline, be aware their customer service is extremely poor."
Amaszonas,"✅Trip Verified|  Santa Cruz to La Paz. I forgot my Bose headphones in the plane and contacted the airline already 4 times via their customer services e mail address! I didn't get any response! I am very angry and will never use this airline, I know that it was my fault but not getting any response isn't a good service in 2017."
Amaszonas,✅Trip Verified|  La Paz to Rurrenabaque. Avoid - will cancel flights and move you onto other flight times without any contact. We arrived at airport to find both legs had been cancelled and we were on different flight times which meant a complete change of plans and additional costs incurred. They claimed not to have contact details despite us proving we had provided these (as they had contacted us to confirm booking and provide tickets via email). Check in staff will also just shrug their shoulders and will not even provide an apology. Make sure you reconfirm your flight the day before but be warned at the check in desk they reserve he right to cancel / change flights up to 2 hours before with no warning or refund!
Amaszonas,"✅Verified Review|  La Paz to Rurrenabaque. They changed our flights last minute with no warning. We were literally at the gate and they told us they had to change the times due to ""operational reasons"". Because of this we are missing an already paid organised tour. This also applies to the flight back from Rurrenabaque. Worst company ever."
Amaszonas,"✅Verified Review|  Asuncion to La Paz via Santa Cruz. Booked these flights through Opodo as I could not find Amaszonas website. Flight to take off 1330 with 50 minute stopover in Santa Cruz but nobody could tell me if I had to go through Immigration/Customs and if so, in time for connecting flight. Received flight time change a day later: now with 2 hours 20 minutes stopover. Received third flight time change a further day later: now 0820 from Asuncion with 9 hours  stopover in Santa Cruz. Phoned Opodo and asked for a refund but was asked to wait and see if another flight was available. Received fourth flight time change 10 days later: take off 0820 from Asuncion with 1 hour 30 minutes stopover in Santa Cruz. Received fifth flight time change seven days later: take off 0820 from Asuncion with 1 hour 40 minutes stopover in Santa Cruz. Checked-in for flight and an Australian family was having a loud argument with staff as their flight time had been changed to the afternoon but they had not been informed by Amaszonas. Flight left on time. Yes, had to go through Immigration/Customs in Santa Cruz. I was the first at both but quite a queue formed behind me. Found Departures at Santa Cruz airport and checked-in for flight to La Paz. Had time for a drink. Don't think the first schedule of 50 minutes would have been sufficient. No complaint when actually on the flights but why, oh, why did Amaszonas change my flights 5 times. Did not inspire me with confidence."
Amaszonas,"✅Verified Review|  Cusco to Uyuni via La Paz. My experience with Amaszonas was good actually. Luckily the weather was in my favor too. Initially I was a little skeptical after reading reviews, but the trip was pretty smooth. Flight was on the smaller side although not as small as people had initially mentioned. There's about 15 to 20 rows of seats and I was comfortable. THe only thing is they board like 15 minutes prior to departure which makes you a little nervous, but the trip as such was okay."
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Not much I can say that hasn’t already been said, other than that it’s all true. I’ve been a frequent flyer for 23 years now, and I can confidently state that of all the airlines I’ve flown, AA by far has the worst customer service, even within the US, which is already a very low bar. Delays, cancellations, and other problems are bound to happen with any airline, but the flippant, glib and couldn’t care less attitude with which these are handled by the AA staff is infuriating. Stay away."
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| I purchased a Flagship 1st Class ticket for a long haul, lie flat seat to Rome from Dallas. The price was approximately $3800 dollars with a standard ticket costing about $700 at the time. Due to a knee injury, it was important for me to have the ability to lie flat, which is why I purchased that specific seat type. Upon boarding the flight, I was unaware my seat was broken. After the flight reached a safe altitude to adjust our seats, the captain allowed us to unbuckle our seatbelts and walk around the cabin. I realized my electronic control panel was not working and I was unable to move my seat. I called Michelle and Mats, the flight attendants serving our area, and notified them of the issue. Michelle let me know the seat was known to be broken and could not be adjusted through the control panel due to a power failure. Any seat manipulation would require it to be done manually by two flight attendants. I requested another seat due to seeing a couple available, and she informed me they were for the cabin crew. So, I let her know I needed to figure something out due to my seat being broken. She then requested another attendant to help her manually move the seat, and after attempting this, the seat jammed and was left pushed forward with the seat back leaning forward, as well. For the entire duration of the flight, 10+hours, I was unable to sit upright, recline, nor was I able to use any electronic functionality of my seat. Furthermore, due to the seat being stuck leaning forward, the tray table to eat was also unable to be opened, so I had an issue with dining. Michelle realized this was an issue and contacted American Airlines Customer Relations during the flight to request they reach out to me about this ordeal. Michelle let me know that AA knows about damaged seats and plane issues but were opting to wait for major renovations to their fleet in October. I questioned why they would sell a premium seat knowing the seat was damaged, and she told me it is a known frustration throughout multiple flight attendants. No matter what, American will not refund my money."
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Both flights were on time and very smooth. Plenty of legroom in the Main Cabin Extra seats. Connecting to inflight WiFi was very easy with a good selection of movies, music and live tv. Flight crew was very pleasant providing friendly and efficient service."
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   In my opinion, the crew was not concerned about flight safety. I was seated in the emergency exit row at seat 17A. The crew only asked the passengers sitting in the emergency exit rows for verbal confirmation that we would assist in evacuating passengers, although three of them were elderly. One of them had difficulty moving and appeared to be over 80 years old! I respect the elderly, but how can a person help in a real-life emergency if they cannot respond quickly? The emergency exits were cluttered with passengers’ hand luggage, and none of the crew asked to place it in the overhead compartments, which had enough space available. On the next flight, all 12 seats in the emergency exit row were empty, which contradicts safety regulations. In the event of an emergency, there would be no passengers who were briefed and responsible for opening the emergency exits. This would hinder an effective evacuation of the passengers. In my 8 years of working in aviation, I have never seen such disregard for safety."
American Airlines,"Not Verified| Due to an accident that occured on my way to the airport I was unable to make it in time for my flight from Tampa to Charleston, so I purchased a new flight same day to Charleston - unbeknownst to me my following flight was also canceled with absolutely no recourse offered by the airline even though the flight still had availability I would have had to purchase a new ticket with absolutely no credit. That to me is deplorable and predatory practice and the customer service agent I spoke to was rude and completely unapologetic about the matter as well. I will never fly with that airline again."
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   We purchased their main cabin extra seats for the extra leg room and location of seats. We chose our seats at the time of purchase. After flying into Dallas for our connection we were informed that our seats had been moved to standard seats. I called and was told I'd receive a refund within 24 hours. When I didn't I called again and was told I had to call after our trip was completed. So I did and was told I had to email them for the refund. So I did. Now I'm being told that they won't refund me because those seats are 'if available'. How do you charge someone $140 extra per seat, have them chose the seat and then tell them they're not available but keep their money? What a scam. And to top it off we paid for seats together and were switched on 3 out of 4 flights and were nowhere near each other."
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Worst flight experience ever. Old outdated plane. Uncomfortable cramped seats with the shortest leg room I have ever seen in a long haul flight. Makes Ryanair feels premium in comparison. On top of that for what ever reason, at last minute before boarding they asked me checkin my hand luggage because overhead compartments were supposedly full. But once in the plane, it was obvious half of the overhead compartments were empty. Is this what the supposedly most advanced country in the world has to offer as a company?"
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   American 'delayed' Airlines does it again! An hour and a half delay, with annoyed employees and an email I received that said the gate changed when it didn't. Why do I continue to fly with this miserable airline? Well, if there is a specific airport I want to fly out of, on a specific day and time, sometimes AA is the only choice I have."
American Airlines,✅Trip Verified|   This will be the last time I fly American. I was forced to check my bag even though I saw we had bin space. I had a bag sent to be picked up for not other reason the young lady boarding the plane’s arrogance and her unwillingness to listen. The plane had plenty of overhead space. I asked if I could have my carry on with me. This isn’t the first time something like this happened. The stewardess attempted to get my bag on board. However the rep letting us on the plane rolled her eyes and refused and said I’d have to wait. Three empty bins from my count.
American Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   The workers in TSA in Logan airport are rude and act like they are on a power trip. They wouldn’t accept my son’s ID, the guy was shaking his head at me. The TSA workers singled me and my disabled son out checking out bags rifling through them carelessly saying that there were chemicals on our bags. Telling us to “stand over there!” Very rudely. The plane we went on had an hour delay. Then we get another surprise and had to pay an extra $115 for seats that I thought I already paid for. I couldn’t sit next to my autistic son, even though I had to pay extra for our seats and my son was vomiting on the plane. I will never fly with American Airlines ever again."
American Eagle,"Not Verified|   There was no problems, everything was good except a 30 minute delay. The seat was ok the, legroom was decent, but the cabin was a little dirty. The crew was nice. Overall it was pretty good."
American Eagle,"Not Verified|  The delay is just crazy! The first thing related to Heavy rain and little storm, its still reasonable for the delay at that time for around 1.5 hrs. And then, they allows us to boarding and waits for 45 minutes in the airplane after the door closed. Next, I think due to queue in the taxy way, we just being round and around the airport for 1 hour. And they decided to back to gates because need to refuel the airplane. Took around 45 minutes, and the passenger allowed to go out to have a quick drink, or to bathroom while refueling. After that due one passenger decided to leave, all the passengers need to leave the airplane and re-boarding again and wait for like 10 minutes again in the terminal. After that, we fly to GSO normally. Well, maybe the story a little bit doesn't make sense, but that's happening"
American Eagle,"✅Trip Verified|  The first leg of my trip on the American Eagle from Palm Springs, ca to Phoenix, Az flight was on time with no issue, but, my return from Phoenix to Palm Springs, ca, that was supposed to leave at 5:35 pm was continually being updated on the screen and did not leave until after around 9pm.. a little over an hour before we boarded, I visited the American Airlines customer service office next to our boarding location, I was told that American Eagle was not American Airlines etc and she looked on her computer screen and then told me some story about not knowing exactly what the delay was, possibly birds flying into an engine delayed crew members from arriving (but the plane was there and the pilots were already there walking around waiting to board the plane to go to Palm Springs, as well). Anyway, two flight attendants showed up and we were able to board. I asked one of the attendants (who was very helpful and courteous) if she had been flown in to work the flight (I thought what the woman said earlier might have been valid and that the crew that might have been on a plane that dealt with birds flying into the engine, caught a different flight to attend to the plane in Phoenix) but she said there were two no-call no-shows and she and the other attendant were called in to work that flight. Thank goodness those two women showed up or who knows how long it would have taken for us to get out of that airport. I know we cannot blame the entire airline for irresponsible crew members, but there is obviously something going on there. Maybe they need to have overflow staff to assure flights are not delayed due to staff members not showing up."
American Eagle,"✅Trip Verified|  Very great experience. Will 100% fly again. Comfort was great, loved the free food and snacks. Also crew was very nice and always tried to help me whenever I needed help."
American Eagle,Not Verified|  Before even getting on the flight the staff was rude and said we have to valet our roller bag and said they don't care if we miss our connecting flight that we have no choice and you have to deal with it. When we get to Charlotte we are instructed to wait on the right hand side of the bridge to get our bags. We do just that. We are then yelled at multiple times to move from the ground crew even though we did exactly what they instructed us to do. Needless to say they need to work on their customer service and learn how to treat passengers.
American Eagle,Not Verified|  Honestly American Airlines has to do much better. These carriers they use for smaller cities are tiny and full to capacity. There’s barely any room to move. Why in the world when I am booking American Airlines am I being assigned this carrier? I think this information should be better disclosed to passengers when they are purchasing their flights. The plane smelt like pee and we were delayed by over 15 minutes without any explanation. It’s like an expensive bus ride to upstate NY without any damn amenities. So long as they continue to utilize this carrier for the the airport I live near to I won’t be booking any flights with with them.
American Eagle,"Not Verified|  I want to strongly recommend the Disabled Persons Services employee, Kevin, who helped transport me across three terminals at LAX this week. He is personable, efficient, and highly competent at his job. We really needed someone like him that morning."
American Eagle,"✅Trip Verified| Absolute garbage. Boarded the plane only to be told to get off, Cancelled our flight and didn’t even inform us, refused to talk to customers at the kiosk, then informs us that they can’t get us to our final destination of San Francisco (one of the larges cities on the West Coast) until 36hrs after we are supposed to arrive. Lost AB&B, lost car reservation with car seat (that they aren’t going refund us for), and now we’re have to make up 2 days of travel hurrying to a wedding in Oregon, losing the time we were gonna spend driving the PCH (which is half of our trip). Please for the love of God choose a different airline."
American Eagle,"Not Verified|  Our American Eagle Flight from SRQ to Charlotte (flt. 5521 departing SRQ at 1:30 pm on April 13) was unfortunately not wonderful. The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them. But my attitude is always positive and welcoming and I expect no less than those whose service I have procured - and this was clearly substandard."
American Eagle,"✅Trip Verified|  Do not fly American Eagle. I flew on flight 6002 March 11,2022 from Montgomery to Charlotte. This was the worst flight ever. Their customer service is ridiculous. We landed in Spartanburg NC for a reason that no one knew. We were held on the plane for 4 hours waiting plus the 5:30am flight which was 50 minutes. The entire flight lost their connection flights and had to suffer the long day at the air port because no one knew how to connect a flight to another flight. We weren’t given any options. Nothing to help us get through. Some customers had medical Conditions that required eating before medication and nothing. As we were waiting the toilets got stuffed up and couldn’t flush any more. The seats we sat in basically had no support in the middle and sagged down the center. It was painful sitting and waiting. All in all this will be the last time I fly this airline."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   ANA might not be the cheapest airline, but every time I fly with them, I conclude that the premium is worth it. This was my tenth flight with ANA and like all the other flights, it was a good experience. Takeoff and landing were smooth and on time. The cabin attendants and airport staff are the best out of all the airlines I have experienced. I just wish for the snack before arrival in the paper box to be of better quality. I knew what I was in for so I passed on it this time. If they scrap it altogether that would be fine as well. I could also be happy with more bags of senbei instead. The in flight wifi is also quite weak. It's hard to load videos. The most you can do is some light web browsing and email."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Boarding by bus, old plane, old entertainment. Not what you expect from a Japanese airlines. So disappointing, I will try to avoid ANA as much as possible."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Purchased two return tickets - Sydney to Tokyo premium economy class. My partner and I were embarking on a short holiday. After the tickets had been purchased and payment made, seat selection became available. Unfortunately only one seat could be selected. We were advised that the other passenger would need to check in at the airport. This was not satisfactory. It seemed clear that the flight had been oversold and there was only one seat available. Indeed, it was not clear to us that we would both be traveling on that flight which was very worrying. We attempted to communicate with the airline by email and multiple phone calls up to 2 weeks before departure. We received no response. At the airport on the departing flight from Sydney, we made contact with ANA staff and attempted to secure two seats travelling together as would be the norm. The only offer to rectify the situation was to arrive early at check-in and hope that one of the passengers with seats already selected would agree to move to give us access to sit together. This was the only resolution offered. We had to wait until every other passenger in that class checked in to that flight to see if they would agree to move. We were advised that this was not likely to be successful. We became quite assertive. Not unreasonable in the circumstances. As a result we understand that one passenger was moved to business class to allow us to sit together. We embarked on the flight angry but relieved. The flight itself was satisfactory. At the time we requested that ANA properly assign us seats together for the return leg from Tokyo to Sydney. We were informed no action was possible. Accordingly, we arrived at the Tokyo airport 2 days prior to departure to talk to airline staff about the problem. Our assigned seats were not together again. ANA staff listened to our problem. Initially they said that they could not help us. Subsequently similar offer was made. ANA offered to request at check in that a passenger move to give us the possibility of sitting together. This was to be a replay of the Sydney debacle. Now, given that this problem was created by the airline overselling seats on the flight we would expect a solution from ANA. Rather than us being treated like problems and beggars for wanting to sit together for a 9-hour flight. We accept that ANA check-in staff at Haneda tried their best to help us. However, even after escalating the issue twice to more senior staff we were simply told there was nothing that could be done. So in summary. ANA oversells seats and then treats passengers as second class citizens when they are impacted by this unethical practice. We recommend people intending to travel from Australia to Japan on ANA airlines reconsider their options or, at the very least be careful dealing with this company. We will certainly never fly with them again. As a Qantas gold frequent flyer, I have had issues with that airline from time to time but never anything like this. Qantas you are forgiven. I'm coming back."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   The service and comfort is correct and equivalent to other companies in Eco Premium. One advantage is the access to lounge. Food on board are same as eco and the only real difference is the seat a little bit more confortable. But don't imagine you will have a good night on a 12 hours flight. In fact you will have more privacy and much less chance of having an impolite person behind you that is shaking and hitting your seat. ANA didn't transfer the miles for this trip to Thai Airways as requested. I send many messages, talk to the Chatbot, but after one month no news and impossible to talk to somebody."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|    If you check in at Chicago O’Hare with two bags, you must out one bag into the scale first, take it off the scale again and put your second bag on. The check-in person then checks the weight of each bag. And only when he gives you the “go ahead”, you are allowed to put the first back onto the scale again. Great procedure for the elderly who suffer from severe Arthritis like me and there is nobody there to help you. Then, the hand luggage is checked too, and if its above 10kg, you are made to unpack. You get to use a lounge, which in my case was United’s Club Lounge, pretty miserable lounge. If you want for instance a drinkable glass of wine, you pay $9 per glass! Flying Premium Economy with an isle seat gives you Boarding Group 5, the last boarding group. On board, you get slightly larger seats and leg space, plus the same meals as in Economy (food was average, at best. Is it worth paying a premium for Premium Economy on ANA. I think not! The crew were very nice."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   The aircraft type was changed, some days prior, without asking the Passengers if we agreed. I have never flown on a -10 series B787 and it was most uncomfortable. This was noisy. not so stable, and the claimed comfort from a higher pressurization is a lie. My food served for lunch was uneatable. The ice cream desert was so hard, could not be eaten.  Of course, the Cabin Attendants were flawless, and so was the service."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   A family of four, with two young children, flew from Phoenix at 7 a.m. to arrive in San Francisco two hours later, excited for their connecting flight to Tokyo, only to find out at the gate that their flight was delayed by six hours. No communication by text or email. The gate agent, while packing up their belongings, announced that they couldn’t answer questions and directed us to call United to see if we were entitled to a dining voucher for the airport. We missed a prepaid night at our hotel and our pick-up arrangement—worth a few hundred dollars—without anyone at the gate counter to assist us. Fast forward four hours, and the new agent at the counter issued us four ($30) food vouchers, valid for that day. Guess what? By then, we had already paid for our food and drinks. My seat wouldn’t recline, and the outlets or USB ports in the seats wouldn’t charge our devices. The $80 we spent on full-day Wi-Fi for four devices turned out to be a joke. The cabin was too hot, and the food was mediocre. The dessert was handed to us in the form of mini ice cream bars, so frozen that we had to hold them for 10 minutes before they were edible. And there wasn’t even an option for Sprite or 7-Up."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   The ground staff and flight crew on NH 848 deserve the highest praise. They went beyond any expectation and worked a miracle. I am deeply impressed by their dedication to their work. I am deeply grateful to them. Our gate at Suvarnabhumi airport had a large waiting area with several phone charging stations. I sat at one end, farthest from the gate, where no one else was sitting. I set my phone and power brick to charge. I boarded, sat down and waited. Minutes before we took off, a stewardess asked me if the phone and power brick she held in her hand was mine. I didn't even know I had left it in the waiting area. Please understand how much of a miracle this is. My phone and power brick are both black. I left them on top of the charging station, which is also black. After everyone boarded, the staff must have walked through the entire waiting area and scanned for left items, and had an eagle eye to spot the black phone on a black background. Furthermore, my phone does not have my name on it. The home screen has a smiling picture of my wife, but it is mostly obscured by the time. I can only guess they walked the aisles of the plane, saw her sitting next to me, and made the connection. They made no general announcement to the passengers about a lost phone. They simply found me. I thanked the stewardess profusely, but she simply bowed with a smile and went back to work, as if this was something normal. I travel extensively, mostly in the US. I have experienced, and witnessed, a lot of good ground staff and cabin crew work (and sadly, a lot of bad). Never before, however, have I experienced such a high level of detail, discretion, and humility--as if what they did was normal and everyday. Thank you ANA. You have earned a lifelong fan."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified| We took this domestic flight from Tokyo to Sapporo. The check-in was not smooth because we did have problem with luggage from previous flight from Bangkok but due to very kind and helpful ANA ground staff, we were able to pick up our luggage at Custom and check-in on time before boarding. The flight was smooth but the plane arrived a little late than schedule. The service onboard was disappointing even though it was evening flight. We were served only a cup of water. We expected to be served with snack, soft drinks or at least a bottle of water on a domestic flight."
ANA All Nippon Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   We flew ANA for the first time in more than 20 years. This time from Bangkok to Tokyo(Narita). The check-in and boarding was smooth. The seat was nice and comfortable. The air crew was very nice and kind enough to change our seat to more comfortable one due to our age. The service by both Japanese and Thai air crew onboard (Row 21-40) was very nice , friendly and helpful. The meal was not tasty and we were quite disappointed. The flight arrive a little early. We made a mistake regarding luggage as we thought that the luggage would be check through for another flight to Sapporo but in fact we have to pick up our luggage and check-in again for domestic flight. We learnt later before boarding time and the ANA ground crew were very nice and helpful to solve the problem. One young female ANA staff took us back to Custom and pick up our luggage and check-in again which we were very much appreciated. The service by ANA crew both air and ground crew should receive our commendation. Excellent."
AnadoluJet,✅Trip Verified| I have booked the seats for me and my daughter and the staff changed the seats which made me 36 and my daughter 15. When I asked the staff to keep our seats she said it’s system and when I asked at least put my daughter next to me she said it’s not my job. The surprise that the seat next to me in 36 was empty. Really rude and disrespectful staff
AnadoluJet,"Not Verified|   The worst airline experience of my life. The staff are incompetent, unprofessional and unhelpful. They refused to let us board our connecting flight (despite a delay on their end), made us wait for over two hours to rebook us, only for us to find out (by checking the airport screen) that our flight was anyway delayed by 4 hours!"
AnadoluJet,"Not Verified| This airline has been Ajet and now the service is horrible. Very greedy and unprofessional. I cancelled my flight due to illness and they had to refund according to terms but they haven’t. Horrible service, selling even water after paying hundreds of pounds for ticket. Such a greedy company to be avoided!"
AnadoluJet,"Not Verified|  Anadolu Jet has launched AJET, I had a flight with them with a route from Dubai to Izmir. From ground services to their timings, it was a chaotic circus—door-to-door max. The 7-hour journey is now in its 17th hour, and they are unable to find the luggage of only four people in Izmir. Everything that can happen wrong, from not being able to print boarding passes to delaying every connected flight and sending luggage to the wrong destination happened."
AnadoluJet,"Not Verified|   This trip wasn’t a good experience. The staff was very blunt and rude. The staff on Sabiha international airport is even worse. It was my first time at this airport and even the way they check for security is extremely uncomfortable, the body check for females is done openly and in the most obscene manner with staff shouting at you. I am not generally the kind to complain and leave a review, but if anyone here reads my review and is able to avoid this unpleasant experience then at least I’ve done my job by helping you. Please avoid this airline and avoid traveling via this airport."
AnadoluJet,"✅Trip Verified|  Never again! The worst airline ever, horrible ground staff at SAW airport, unpleasant cabin crew, delays of a few hours, not speaking English, announcements in Turkish only! Lost baggage, stress and inconveniences with no compensation. I flew from SJJ to DXB over SAW to and back, both times delays, drama and no one was responsible. Avoid."
AnadoluJet,"Not Verified|  Avoid, especially if expecting to join a connecting flight as they will be at least an hour late arriving. Used several times on this route and they have never once been on time. Also to bear in mind, unless booked well in advance they are not much cheaper than alternatives from the larger and better airports. Turkish Airlines have systemically withdrawn services from Istanbul Sabhia making it next to useless as a transit hub. Stansted is just too small and they expect you to walk to the aircraft in the rain and luggage is always late arriving from the aircraft and also left in the rain. AnadoluJet has removed almost every element of usefulness from their aircraft and kept it very basic, limited leg room, uncomfortable seats. (Thin cushions), No charging points even tho you need your iPad or phone for entertainment as there are no on board options. No wifi of course. Food is a really dreadful roll with no choice options. Drink choice is orange juice tea or coffee or water. Both thrust at you 20 minutes after seatbelt signa go off, so that the crew can go and sit down and ignore you for the next 3 hours. No communication whatsoever regarding delays and of course no apology for missed connections etc. I would avoid like the plague and as TA have done, remove anadolujet or AJet as they will become shortly, from any travel options you are presented with. Without redeeming features and not recommended."
AnadoluJet,"✅Trip Verified|   The flight from Astana to Ankara was delayed on December 31, because of bad weather. Anadolujet treated us really good, information was given, a bus came to take us to Marriott which is a 5 star hotel, we were given individual rooms, meals and spa. And the next day we were able to fly to Ankara to catch the new year . I almost became happy the flight was delayed."
AnadoluJet,"✅Trip Verified|   I had a skateboard with me in a separate bag. At check-in they inspected it, put stickers on it and told me to take it with me on board the plane. I asked if it was extra luggage for me, I was ready to pay for it. The girl at the check-in replied that no. I asked again, is it sure to take it with me on board the airplane? The check-in girl said yes. I don't fly much, especially as I thought the staff should know better, so I listened. All in all, when checking my hand luggage, the skateboard was taken away from me by the airport staff. They didn't explain anything, just said ""Problem"", and the most I got: they took me to the AnadoluJet window. Actually, everything could have been solved at this point. After all, the flight was 2 hours away. Check-in was still open, a representative of the company could have taken the skateboard from security and handed it over to the luggage compartment at check-in. But alas! The man from Anadolu Jet without asking took away passports and tickets from everyone who was near the window. When I tried to explain my situation, I got only a dry nod in response, nobody listened to me. Then he explained something to the passengers for a long time in Turkish. Finally he said that we had to go with a man to get our luggage and then we would have our tickets changed if we didn't make the flight. He was asked, ""Will your company exchange the tickets for free?"". He said: ""Yes."" In the baggage area, no one spoke English from the staff (in an international airport on an international flight). I waited a very long time for my luggage, they didn't bring the longboard even though they promised. I had to walk around and communicate with airport security myself to have it returned. Next is the most interesting part. I go to the AnadoluJet window and ask to exchange the ticket. I am told the cost of the ticket is 16524 lira (about 550 euros)! I tried to find out why, in the end I got the employee's answer: ""You are late, it's your fault it was canceled"". Such a confident answer, although she didn't even know what the reason for the cancellation was. I tried to explain that it wasn't my fault that it was canceled, that at check-in their employee told me to take my skateboard on board, even though it was not allowed. And that another employee of their company said that the ticket exchange would be free. But the customer care service didn't care about that. The customer care service is terrible! In the end I took a ticket from another company, which cost 200 euros instead of 550 and there was no problem with the skateboard at all!"
AnadoluJet,"✅Trip Verified| My flight from Stansted to Istanbul was delayed for no good reason and with no explanation from the crew at the airport and inside the plane. The crew inside reassured me I would not miss my connection to Tbilisi. However, we arrived about 20-30 minutes late and upon arrival, airport staff told me to go pick up my luggage (which took 1 hour to turn up) and head to Turkish Airlines' hotel desk. They put me up in a hotel and told me they'd rebooked on the same flight - 24 hours later! I arrived at my destination 24 hours late and AnadoluJet  are now denying me compensation on the basis that the delay was beyond their control - they are unsurprisingly doing everything they can to avoid providing me with evidence of that. It's worth noting the exact same thing happened on my way back though that time, I ended up spending 12 hours in the airport as they did not offer me a hotel room. Once again, they denied me compensation on the basis that the delay was beyond their control and continue ignoring my requests for evidence. Their customer service team is helpless and doing everything they can to avoid providing me with the information I requested. They are the most chaotic and unhelpful airline I've ever had to deal with and I do not recommend flying with them. I went to Tbilisi to attend a conference and several people who flew with Turkish Airlines faced similar issues."
Andes Líneas Aéreas,"✅Trip Verified|  We had 2 flights booked and paid with this company, both flights were cancelled, we were stranded in the middle of the country with a cruise ship to catch. They would not reply to email, they have an English contact number, with messages in Spanish, absolutely useless. Took our money and got absolutely nothing. I don't agree with the rating of 1/10, should be zero like the service we received."
Andes Líneas Aéreas,✅Trip Verified|  Buenos Aires to Bariloche. The airline canceled my flight without letting me know. I had paid for 4 passengers. At the check in they informed me the flight was canceled and they offered no help. I had to book last minute with another airline for over twice the cost and Andes Líneas Aéreas still have not reimbursed my money.
Andes Líneas Aéreas,"✅Trip Verified|  Buenos Aires to Iguazu. Our flight was cancelled 20 minutes before departure time; no planes available! After standing in line for hours the airline just reimbursed our airfare. No other flights were offered and no hotel or food vouchers either. We were few lucky ones who flew out on another airline at $1,000 extra cost for a one hour flight. Our ticket was part of a package. I would avoid this airline at all costs in future."
Andes Líneas Aéreas,"✅Trip Verified|  Tucuman to Buenos Aires. This airline is a mess. Our flight was delayed for 10 hours without notification, we were dropped at the wrong airport, and missed our hotel reservation and were forced to sleep in the airport. No accommodations were made by the airline and we were just notified that our flight back is changed again. This is unacceptable. This airline has caused people to miss reservations, wait long hours, and nothing changes."
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified|   On September 30, 2024, while at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I learned that my flight 336 to Toronto, Canada, was canceled just half an hour before departure. This cancellation significantly impacted our family reunion, reducing my stay in Canada and affecting my reservations there. The financial loss extends beyond the flight ticket to include my hotel expenses in Canada and potential income from my work. Additionally, we were unable to travel on another day due to my job starting on October 1. There has been multiple interactions with Arajet Customer service where Arajet is using different strategies to exhaust customers and avoid providing the appropriate compensation. For example, they refer customers to third parties: Expedia.ca has clearly stated (as noted on their website) that it is the airline's responsibility to issue the refund. It is inappropriate to shift this responsibility to third parties, especially when Arajet is the one that canceled the flight and received the payment (despite Arajet customer service denied it). It continues with one misleading comment after the other. The deliverate goal is taking responsibilities for letting customers left alone in airports and avoid paying. Arajet appears to be implementing strategies that discourage customers from pursuing reimbursement claims. Among these strategies, Arajet focuses on: 1) Complicated Claim Processes: The refund process is cumbersome, requiring extensive documentation that may deter passengers. In our case, we have provided all necessary documents. 2) Partial Refunds with Deductions: We experienced a situation where a ticket refund was issued with fees deducted (over $150), similar to what Arajet has done in our case. 3) Failure to Reimburse for Additional Purchases: Despite providing proof of purchases for luggage and seat selection made the day before departure, Arajet continues to disregard these issues with automated responses from customer service. 4) Leaving mothers with kids left alone in airports with a reschedule ticket in 3-4 days later with no supporting transfers or hotels. Our goals are: 1) Inform other customers of our experience, 2) Allow customers to make inform decisions by avoiding purchasing tickets with Arajet, 3) Obtain the reimbursement (proof of purchases ticket, seat selection, baggage, transportation to the airport/return were provided)."
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified| The first time flying with this company, ARAJET. Because I missed my flight. I usually fly with legacy airline about 5 to 7 time a year, mainly for business, and I only travel with a carry on so that save myself the trouble of running after my luggage. So I purchase a flight with only carry on but careful and read properly they redefined what is a ""carry on"" and got bill almost 200$ to have my carry on. ARAJET YOU ARE NOW BANNED AND I WILL LET MY WALLET TALK."
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified|   My companion and I were impressed for the service and attention by the airline personnel and customer service. The flight was really smooth and easy. The price was very reasonable. Therefore, we did not expect any meal service."
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified|   I had a terrible experience with Arajet on my recent 7-hour overnight international flight. Despite the duration and timing of the flight, no water or food was offered, which is quite concerning for such a long journey. Additionally, the cabin temperature fluctuated drastically between extreme cold and extreme heat. To make matters worse, no blankets or pillows were provided, which is usually standard for overnight flights. On top of that, I was charged $100 for a carry-on bag, which was ridiculous. Overall, I found the service to be extremely lacking and would not recommend flying with Arajet ever."
Arajet,Not Verified|   Worst airline ever! No one cared to help me. My luggage got lost in Santo Domingo. No one knew anything. They placed the wrong gate on the monitor so about 10 of us missed our connecting flight. Got stuck in Santo Domingo and no one wanted to help us/me. Arajet just blamed the airport. I had no luggage nothing with me. I was later told I was out on a flight the next day and had to sleep on the airport floor because no one cared to help even though it was the airline’s fault. I would never recommend this airline. First and last time
Arajet,"Not Verified|   Don't fly with this airline, they didn't put my baggage at the airplane and when I arrived at Dominican Republic my baggage wasn't there. I lost one day on my vacation cause all my personal items and clothes are there and filled a form at the airport also filled another form online and called with costumer service and nobody knows where is it and don't have any idea when I'm gonna have with me. Worst experience flying with this airline, they make a mistake, don't do anything to solve as soon is possible and they don't care"
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified| This is one of the most unprofessional airlines I have ever flown. Shortly after disembarking from my flight from Santo Domingo to Kingston, I realized that I had left my iPad in the seatback pocket. In the terminal, I searched and finally (with some difficulty) found an Arajet employee, who went away and eventually told me no one had removed any iPads from the flight. She could not offer any other advice for recovering it. I subsequently made many attempts to contact Arajet. No one answered when I called their published ""customer service"" phone numbers. I then had an extensive online chat with someone, but she finally reprimanded me for losing my iPad and said if anyone ever found it on the plane and turned it in to the Lost and Found in Santo Domingo, I would have to go there and prove my identity. When I offered to pay to have it shipped to me, she said they would not do that. Over the subsequent days, my Apple ""Find My"" app continued to show that the iPad was at the airport in Santo Domingo. But writing Aerojet resulted in no help of any sort. They appear to lack personnel who can communicate in English. I'm sorry I forgot my iPad. I did not mean to do that. But passengers DO forget things and Arajet clearly has no interest in helping them get their possessions back. The entire operation reeks of disrespect for passengers."
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified|  This is the most unprofessional and horrible airline I have ever used in my life.  The worst customer service, the worst underground crew, worst reception and worst personel at the airport. I purchased a flight from Toronto to Sao Paulo. I was supposed to fly in June 12, but due to some issues I decided to change my flight to June 4. I was told that I would be charged 75 Canadian dollars as penalty. I agreed because this is my decision. So during the change, I did a mistake by choosing June 6 and the payment was done already. When I realised it immediately I called the customer service to help me out, I got rude customer agents and telling me that I still have to pay another 75 Canadian dollar, for the new change, they said they don't care about the mistake and I should pay. I finally paid. On the day of the flight, the fare I purchased was allowed me a 10kg baggage, but during my check-in, I was informed rudely that I have to pay 140 Canadian dollars to be able to fly.  I tried everything by even showing the fare I purchased on Arajet website. The lady told me rudely: <>. Also the flight has a 4 hours delay. They sell food in the plane, no snack is free, even water you have to buy. It was my first time to fly with this airline, but the worst experience ever. I will never ever take it again."
Arajet,"✅Trip Verified|  Arajet is the worst airline I have used. There was a man who took photos of my documents, passport and residence card with his personal cell phone. This has never happened to me with Air Transat or Air Canada. I don't think it's safe. He told me it was to send to the Santo Domingo team. I thought my problems were over when I finally boarded the plane, but it was only the beginning. The seats are stuck, no water is given. A bottle of water costs 2 US dollars. I bought a chicken and potato dish for 12 US dollars, but I couldn't eat it, it was not good. For my return, I had to return earlier than planned because my son was sick. I changed my ticket on the website and had to pay a fee of 270.88 Canadian dollars. I spent three days trying to pay on the website but couldn't. So I called customer service. When I called customer service, there was an agent who told me there was a problem with MasterCard. This is why payment cannot be made. Well, afterwards, I tried with a Visa card, but that too didn't work. I called again, and there was another agent who left me on the line alone for about 20 minutes, under the pretext that he was looking for a solution. Eventually, I found another person who informed me that payment issues often happen on the Arajet website. He advised me, as I was in Santo Domingo, to go directly to a Pagatodo office. Upon arriving at the Pagatodo office, I was informed that I had to pay in Dominican pesos. I was supposed to pay $270.88 Canadian, but was charged 16,250 Dominican pesos, which works out to about $375 Canadian. It's incredible ! It's theft, there is no coordination, they are amateurs, they are not serious. I do not recommend this airline at all. They say their flights are cheaper, but the price goes up quickly for everything and you end up with a higher price than other standard airlines and very poor service."
Arajet,"Not Verified|   The absolute worst airline I have ever flown with. They sent me an email the day before my flight telling me my flight had been delayed by 1 hour and when I went to the empty check in desk of an empty airport 2 hours before the new departure time I was told that check in was closed (3 hours before departure). When I asked for a refund, the response I received was that they recommend I arrive 3 hours prior to departure and because I was there 2 hours before I was ineligible for a refund. Their policies however state otherwise. And this is the biggest issue. There were so many more - like being unable to check in online and it being framed as my fault for not calling despite using one of their contact numbers, being told we don't need an eticket for transit but then being stuck in the airport as we tried to navigate a system that made no sense. I was actually really excited about this airline and was telling everyone to use it but I have since told them to avoid it at all costs."
Ariana Afghan Airlines,"I flew Ariana Afghan Airlines from Kabul to Delhi. Timing was good, but very crowded while boarding. The flight was enjoyable but no entertainment. Good and enough food provided. Very friendly and helpful staff on the flight. The ticket was very reasonable price."
Arik Air,"Not Verified|  Our flight time was changed from 08.50am to 6pm! I missed all connecting flights, had to pay for another hotel in Abuja and was stuck in limbo. I had already checked out of the hotel. The flight change wasn't communicated and we only discovered when we got to the airport."
Arik Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline in Nigeria. Terrible service delivery. Insincere, bossy and lying customer service agents. Difficult to keep to schedule. Quarrelsome personnel from customer service to Air hostess."
Arik Air,Not Verified|  I am quite accommodating as a person and I have clear understanding of flight logistics challenges. But Arik Air showcased a complete lack of class and a blatant disregard for welfare. It’s disgraceful and outright incompetent. I arrived 55 minutes before flight time and I was unable to check in to get a boarding pass and thus forced to reschedule and it’s particularly painful because I had promised my three year old that I’d be with her. And they were so rude despite my calm demeanor. I’m not one to give bad reviews or reviews in general but here you go. I’d fly Max or Airpeace going forward and I employ others to do the same.
Arik Air,"Not Verified|  The shuttle bus dropped us the passengers at the hanger! The flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt was scheduled at 3pm then rescheduled to 6pm, then again moved to 8.30 and I'm writing this as I board the flight at 9.31 pm. The bus driver who picked us up at mm2 boarding gate dropped us at the hanger and then left stating he has to go home. Serious action should be taken against such irresponsible employees and the airline should be charged a penalty for such negligence while recruiting junior staff. It is not even funny how close we were to another aircraft which was so loud that we had to close our ears. Delay for Arik isn't uncommon but such careless behaviour is unacceptable. I won't be travelling this airline ever again. Apart from no communication for the delay the airline is as worst as it can get in the aviation industry. They have set a new low for themselves."
Arik Air,"Not Verified|  I booked Arik flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt on February 11, 2020 to travel on February 12, 2020 using my GTbank Master Card .The payment was done on Quickteller and it showed that the transaction was successful and my account was debited accordingly. Unfortunately when I got to the airport on February 12,  I was informed at the counter that my booking was not successful and was referred to the payment section. At the payment section I was asked to contact my banker for refund which I did but I was informed by my bank that the error is from Arik. As side the fact that I missed my flight, I have also been made to suffer unduly for the negligence of your organization. I have tried to call your Account Refund line severally but no luck. I lodged the complaint with my bank which in turn contacted Keystone Bank and the bank confirmed that the payment was successful. I also took efforts to visit arik air's office, sent mail but all to no avail. It's quite unfortunate that the airline has not changed for better regarding refunds."
Arik Air,Not Verified|  Lagos to Warri. Terrible. Last seat available was a business class seat at 70k Naira. 30k more than economy class and the same narrow horrible chairs as economy. In fact no difference between classes to justify any price difference on this aircraft. Awfully disappointing.
Arik Air,"Not Verified| Lagos to Accra. From my experience today at Arik Air, I can describe the airline as being terribly inefficient and best avoided. The flight was delayed first for 2 hours with excuses of the plane developing a fault. Later, a staff came to tell us after 2 hours that the plane was now on ground and they were running some checks on it. After another 45 mins another staff came to tell us that actually the plane has not yet landed and they will give us an update in about 20 minutes time. No one is telling us anything and so we do not know whether we will still travel tonight or not. On informing someone about my predicament I was told I made a mistake by buying an Arik Air ticket, that this is their usual practice. I would not advise anyone to travel with this airline."
Arik Air,"✅Trip Verified| Without any doubt the worst business class in Africa. Everything was wrong. Even with a most expensive business class ticket, I was requested to be at the very small and terribly mediocre Freetown airport 2 hours ahead of the flight: when one knows how few flights there are per day, ridiculous. When I checked in I was guaranteed that the flight had taken off from Accra where it came from and was due on time in Freetown, when I checked later with the crew, I found out it was a total lie as the flight was delayed and it was still on the ground at that time. When I checked in, I also asked about the business lounge and was told that of course I could use it, but after immigration I discovered it had been closed and remained closed for the 3 hours I waited: one of the shopkeepers nearby told me that the staff looking after the lounge had left because ""they had other things to do"". So I had to wait on the most uncomfortable metal bench with no air conditioning for 3 hours, nothing else was available. We received no information about the delay and no Arik Air staff were visible after the check-in counter. At 1am, the boarding was done in a most unprofessional way even for this continent where I have been some 3 or 400 times. Exhausted, I'm not very young to say the least, by this horrible experience on the ground I thought I would have 1.5 agreeable hours specially being the only passenger in business class. This was wrong, very wrong. I was first requested to stop using my iPad as Arik seems to be the only airline (with SAA) forbidding the use of an iPad during takeoff and landing. I asked for a glass of wine and was offered a choice between 2 tiny plastic bottles of lukewarm undrinkable wines. Beer was also lukewarm. The dinner consisted of 2 sandwiches, worse than what a low cost airline would offer. The crew was about as nice as their fellow citizens the immigration officers at Lagos airport. Horrible experience at a cost of nearly 700 USD one way for 900 miles. A rip-off would be an understatement."
Arik Air,"✅Trip Verified| Accra to Monrovia. This is a terrible airline. Avoid at all cost. They sent us a message saying we should be there no later than 6am the evening before. We arrived and informed they knew something was wrong with the flight, but they just forgot to update the system. So our flight will now depart at 10:50am. We asked if we could leave and they can send a message when they are ready. They said we should wait. At 9am, we proceeded to check in and was informed now the flight is not leaving till 2pm. We again asked what the issue is, this time they said we don't have a plane. Most airlines on schedule were on time or with even a 20 mins delay, an annoucement was made. Nothing is annouced from this airline, you have to go and search for a representative, hide and seek game. No one really knows whats happening. One employee has advised us to head home, thus will proceed to leave."
Arik Air,"✅Trip Verified| My colleague and I were booked on an Arik Air flight from Lagos to Warri, supposed to depart at 07.40 in the morning. I received a message two days prior to the flight, informing me that ""due to operational requirements"" the flight will operate at 11.00. The morning of the flight, I received another message informing me that again ""due to operational requirements"" the flight will operate at 12.00. Once at the airport, waiting to board, we were informed the flight was delayed 20 minutes. Twenty minutes came and went and we eventually boarded and only took off at 13.00, arriving in Warri by 14.00, only getting to the hospital where we were to have 2 full days of work at 15.30. An entire day wasted by an incompetent airline. It does however get worse, it is now 2 days later and we are supposed to fly from Warri to Lagos, booked on the 09.20 flight. We have a connecting flight to Accra, Ghana at 17.10, so plenty of time to make this connection. Or so you think. I received a message from Arik 2 days ago informing me that ""due to operational"" requirements, the flight will now operate at 12.40. I'm still not too worried, as we will still make the connection. Don't hold your breath. I received another message from Arik this morning at 09.38 informing me that even this amended time has now changed to 16.40. So, to summarize - a flight supposed to have left at 09.20 has now been delayed and yet again delayed to 16.40. I phoned the Arik Air call centre, explained that I will now miss my connection to Ghana. She had absolutely no interest in my case, no offer of assistance. Her single line was ""Arik apologises"". I would not recommend this airline to anyone - despite selling tickets at certain times, they have clearly no intention of sticking to any schedule, making up flying times as it suits their ""operational requirements"". There is nothing positive I can say about this airline."
Arkefly,"Horror flight: Delayed - Seats were double booked, people who paid for more expensive spots had to take a seat in economy, families were split up over the entire airplane. Zero leg space, most of the seats could not lean backwards (if there was a person of +1.8 meters behind you, leaning back would literally crush his/her knees). Unannounced additional stop at Cape Verde, increasing the flight time from 6 to 9 hours. Very poor onboard entertainment and food. All of the above occurred on both flights, so it was not a coincidence."
Arkefly,I was traveling for work to and from Amsterdam to Samos. I was seated on the first row with (even for the B737-8) a lot of space for my legs. Slept almost the whole time so for me this was a perfect flight. Cabin crew were very professional!
Arkefly,AMS-AUA-AMS. I regularly fly ArkeFly between Europe and the Antilles and what a huge difference between the old and worn 767-300 with barely enough space to breathe and the new 787-800 with more spacious seats PTV and a so much better experience. Furthermore the crew seems to enjoy the Dreamliner much more and even smiles are being made! Also the time of always being delayed also seems to be over. ArkeFly improved a lot with the Dreamliner and I even prefer Arkefly above KLM now as long as they fly the Dreamliner.
Arkefly,Flight Cancun-Amsterdam October 2014. Aircraft was changed and passengers like us who had bought comfort class were downgraded to economy. Flight was a nightmare with screaming kids and non-existent flight attendants. Crew blocked some comfort class seats for themselves while passengers who had paid for them flew economy. Do not fly with them!
Arkefly,I flew from Schiphol to Jamaica with ArkeFly. The aircraft was old dirty and noisy. There was minimal legroom which can make a long haul flight very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the flight attendants never have I ever met so many rude flight attendants during one flight. As a passenger you are expected to feel very sorry that you came to disturb the flight attendants during their flight. If you ask for pillow or blanket all you get back is very rude words and eye-rolling you don't feel like a paying customer at all. Also the flight attendants didn't speak English even when I told them that I don't understand Dutch. Unfortunately I cannot recommend ArkeFly to anyone.
Arkefly,Flew Amsterdam - Aruba - Amsterdam (OR363 and OR 364) in July 2014. The outbound flight was on one of the old 767-300's a noticeably old and used aircraft (approx. 25 y/o). The seats in economy provide just enough legroom and you indeed have to pay for everything. Since the flight was only around €50 cheaper than the KLM alternative I would not recommend this one especially due to the old and noisy aircraft the charter flight customers (many crying children) and relatively inattentive crew. However the return flight was a brand new 787 Dreamliner aircraft in which I chose to fly Star Class. The difference is huge. The aircraft is quiet spacious and the seats and service in Star Class are much like Business Class with other premium airlines. You pay €270 for an upgrade which is decent value for money. All in all I would only fly Arkefly (long distance) again if it would be in the 787.
Arkefly,Flight # 396/395: We flew from Toronto to Amsterdam in August. The flight was terrible. We requested 3 vegetarian meals. We did not get our vegan meal until our return to Toronto and to add insult to injury they provided only two meals. Then the steward decided to inform me it was my fault I did not order for 3 passengers. I have proof the request was made for three passengers. Instead of apologizing for the error they diverted the error onto me. For a 10 hour flight and for the price I paid I expected better food drink and entertainment. I'll never recommend Arkefly.
Arkefly,OR365 27/2/14. OR366 13/3/14. We flew from Amsterdam to Bonaire in March 2014. The flight itself was ok but for the price we paid we expected better food and drink than we received. For the 10 hour overnight return flight we waited 2 hours for a small dinner (without drinks service in between) including one tea/coffee/juice. That was it! The only other drinks service was in the morning (2 hours before landing while most people were still asleep) where we had to pay for tea or coffee! We also had to pay extra for the Entertainment system which had a very poor selection.
Arkefly,Flew Amsterdam - Orlando - Miami. There are many signs that Arkefly is simply not a proper airline but just a charter operator. It goes beyond the nickle and diming that other airlines do although Arkefly takes it to a new level. The fun started a day before flying: a text message that the plane would be departing two hours late. On with the seat assignments: you have to pay for those and in a strange move you can't check in online unless you paid for a seat. At the check-in counter they had to call operations for a half hour to get me a seat only for me to find out on the plane it didn't exist. The other thing I found is that the plane was quite old (no proper overhead luggage storage) and seats were cramped old and hard as a rock. Charter flight so lots of really loud crying kids. Up to you if you mind. I flew economy comfort leg room is pretty good. As others mention everything has to be paid for except one meal and drink. No complaints there I knew that was the case and I feel that prices were reasonable. By the way don't bother to pay for IFE the selection is pretty useless. Less palatable was the fact that we were significantly delayed due to two passengers being not being admitted to the US at Orlando (stopover en-route to Miami) who were promptly put back on the plane to fly to Miami and onward to Amsterdam. If Arkefly would do passengers pre-checks in Amsterdam like grown-up airlines this wouldn't have happened.
Arkefly,It is a terrible airline. I flew from Amsterdam to Sanford Orlando. The seats were just terrible. You have to pay for everything. I flew comfort and I expected to have more extras then economy but it was just the same. You only get one meal and water. If you would like a snack or just a coke you will pay for it. I couldn't sit properly in my seat I had to turn myself and lay on my side. Because otherwise I would have been seated at my fellow passengers lap. I do not recommend this airline. And please do not consider to upgrade your flight it isn't worth it. The crew is very unprofessional and will help you with nothing. It's all self service.
Arkia Israeli Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  A disgrace of a company. Delayed my flight twice and then cancelled it without any communication from their side. Getting it refund is a nightmare.
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| The flight got delayed over 2 hours. The gate was changed 3 times without clear updates. The flight attendants took rudeness and careless to a whole new level. Unfortunately I have my return flight scheduled with them. I have sent them a huge complaint, and a refund request. I prefer to fly any other airline with layovers to get to my destination than setting a foot again on an Arkia flight."
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Didn’t make clear that our tickets did not incl baggage but ok we will take responsibility for that one but then the flight was delayed. The flight coming back was outrageous and this is what the review is for. They charged us for baggage on the way out, but had no record on the systems upon coming back so we had to pay a second time. How can any company or airline company charge somebody an additional charge for baggage and not have any indication or even a note on their system? With two small children just for the sake of fees we paid yet again and now are currently standing at an airport waiting for the flight. The flight was scheduled for 4 PM, but then was delayed to 430 and we were messaged on the day, suggesting that another very low cost airline will be flying as back. After progressing through security and passport control, we then find out that the flight has been further delayed to almost 6PM. Expecting yet more delays as we are standing now at a gate with a completely different airline now boarding. I am besides myself and I will never travel with Arkia again."
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"Not Verified| The change our flight twice same day, extremely unreliable and very poor costumer services. Good luck if you are traveling with kids and seniors they will be miserable!"
Arkia Israeli Airlines,✅Trip Verified| Terrible airline. Unreliable. Changed our flights and shortened our trip. Did it in the last minute. No service. No one to talk to. Extremely expensive. You pay a lot for really less than nothing. Should be closed. Be aware and stay away from Arkia.
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"Not Verified|  Made the mistake of choosing Arkia to fly to Paris for an extended weekend. Flight itself wasn't bad - they even gave some cheap promotion gifts to mention that they will be flying the Israeli Olympic team to the games. But - the first flight was postponed by 2 hours, and again by another 2.5 hours, and the return flight was also similarly postponed. Get your act together! Otherwise the Olympic team will arrive only for the closing ceremonies."
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  The worst airline I have seen. First they don’t respect their customers, they only see money in front of them if you have 1 extra kg you will pay for it. They don’t smile. This is the 3rd time I’m flying with them and every time the flight is delayed minimum 2 hours. Do not fly with them even though they give cheap prices. You will end up paying extra and waiting for a very long time."
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  What a horrible experience, booked a flight to Rome from Tel Aviv. apparently this was a charter flight operated by SmartWings. Flight was originally scheduled at 7:25 AM, a few days after ordering the ticket we got an SMS saying it is delayed to 11:00AM. a few days further another SMS and another delay to 14:00 PM. we were at the airport with our 1.5 years old baby, at 11:00AM , 3 hours prior to our flight and not to our surprise, another delay, first to 16:00PM, eventually we took off at 18:00PM (from originally 7:25AM flight). when talking to people on the plane, this is a well known tactic of Arkia airline. Early online check-in was not possible due to site crashing. Ground staff was so rude when i asked to sit with my wife and kid, telling me i should have checked online. They didn't care at all when i tried to explain i couldn't since their website is as basic as it gets. We arrived in Rome at 10:00PM, losing a whole day (including a payed night up north) and needed to pay the extra night in Rome too. This is by no doubt the worst ever flying experience i have ever had."
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  We were late arriving to SSH, and only an hour and half late departing SSH on our flight back to TLV, but that seems normal for Arkia. Buying a ticket was easy on their website, but in no place did I notice that this was a charter flight. The expensive ticket price was not charter air fare price. A few days after baying the ticket received notice departure from SSH was changed three hours later making us miss the last train for the night. Arkia can only be reached via WhatsApp the problem is they never bother to answer no matter how many times or how many days we try to reach them. After paying for the tickets Arkia total disconnect us we were on our own unable to change our tickets . Arkia's own luggage regulation means nothing the Arkia rude ground crew do as the please. Our carry on were sent to to luggage hold in the plane but other passengers seemed to be excluded and carried on the plane two carry on and personal hand bags. In the carryon bin above our seats were other seats carry on luggage. I asked the crew why we were forced to give up our carry on while other did not, I just got a dirty look and walked away. First and last time for me on Arkia. Even free would never fly with Arkia."
Arkia Israeli Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Flight was delayed by 2 hours, the airline did not attempt to contact and notify on the delay (aircraft hasn't left the origin country on time, so it was known to the airline at least 8 hours in advance). Upon arrival at the airport, we saw the flight was delayed, so sat for a cup of coffee. We came to check in 3 hours prior to take off (updated time), to discover our premium economy (bought and paid for) seats were given to other passengers. The ground crew was incredibly rude about it."
Armenia Air Company,"✅Trip Verified|  This is by far the worst and non-reliable airline I've ever used. They departed 3 hours before the departing time shown on the ticket without notice. When I asked for the refund, they are keep saying we will pass this email to specialist but didn't hear from specialist for almost one months. Of course they did not refund the ticket. Do not use this airline if you want to ruin your holiday. Also, whatever they say, you won't get the money back since they will never reply your email."
Armenia Air Company,"✅Trip Verified|  This is the worst airline I had experience with. My flight was cancelled so that I wasn't informed about it. Employees of the company office located in Yerevan are so much unprofessional that it's better not to ask them even elementary question as their answer anyway will be - ""I don't know"". They don't speak English at all and their Russian is totally impossible to understand. When you call to their office, minimum 10-12 times you should call to be answered once, messenger works terribly, nobody gives you proper replies. This is the company with non-professional, irresponsible and incompetent staff with incompliant service and terrible attitude to their customers."
Armenian Airlines,"Not Verified|  Absolute disaster. AT NO COST, look further, never fly with them! Armenian Airlines made my flight unbearable. You can’t check in online unless you pay for a seat — a blatant money-grabbing tactic. They nitpick everything, including bags, as if their goal is to ruin your mood. Trying to contact them is a joke: phone lines are silent, and they ignore messages on Facebook and other platforms. Their complete disregard for customers leaves only a feeling of disgust. I never thought an airline could be this atrocious. I wouldn’t recommend dealing with them to anyone."
Armenian Airlines,"Not Verified|  If I could give Armenian Airlines negative stars, I would. My recent experience with this airline was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, it was a comedy of errors that left me questioning why I ever chose to fly with them in the first place. Let's start with the booking process. Trying to book a flight with Armenian Airlines felt like navigating a labyrinth designed by a sadistic genius. Their website was a hot mess of broken links, confusing menus, and error messages. It took me longer to book my ticket than it did to plan my entire trip. If that doesn't scream ""user-unfriendly,"" I don't know what does. The day of my flight arrived, and I foolishly thought that the worst was behind me. Oh, how wrong I was. The check-in process at the airport was a disaster. The line was longer than the Great Wall of China, and the staff seemed completely disinterested in helping passengers. I had to wait for what felt like an eternity before I could even drop off my luggage."
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Boeing 777 HNL-ICN not too bad for comfort with 3x3x3 seating, two meals and a snack but strange menu choices. Steak and potatoes with a side of cold cuts and cheese in a roll. ICN-BKK on a well worn A330 and an entertainment system that belongs in a museum. The price paid did not compensate for the product. Also what's with the brown uniform the cabin crew have to endure?"
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   In this month, I flew from Bangkok to Incheon with Thai and return with Asiana, and there is a striking difference. Compared to Thai in business class, Asiana's performance was poor: no welcome drink no amenity kit (just slippers and wet tissues) very bad entertainment system (old fashioned controller, small screen, bad picture and no noise cancelling earphones, with limited amounts of movies). Meals are ok, but I was served 3 times the same cheese platter, limited selection of wines no digestive offered water bottles were not put at disposal on the seats Service was good and efficient and friendly, but this does not compensate for the rest."
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   It was my first time to fly with Asiana Airline. Service is world class, check in counter staff are super friendly. Flight crew are very friendly, excellent service, always there on call, you press button and the air hostess is there. Always smiling. Food was beyond and above the first class standard. I flew Sydney to New York via Incheon Seoul, all flights had the same standard. Desk crew in JFK New York was just as friendly. I give Asiana Airline for punctuality, on time arrival and departure 10/10 . I give them 10/10 for flight crew, I give them 10/10 for food quality ."
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I just experienced Asiana Airlines. Business class food delicious, flight attendants good service. I give 4 stars because flight is delay 57 minutes and does not have wi-Fi"
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I do not recommend this airline. We are currently stuck for 24 hours in Korea, cannot leave the airport, no access to their lounge, due to their failed scheduling. Our outbound flight (ICN-CNX)was changed to depart 30 minutes earlier than scheduled 2 days ago. Then our first flight (JFK-ICN) was delayed by 45 minutes the day before departure. Then on the actual day of departure it was delayed another 1 hour 20 minutes, making it impossible to meet the connection. When this was brought to the attention of the JFK staff their reply was, ""nothing we can do"" when in fact they hade several reroute choices for JFK-CNX available. We were told to get on a flight knowing we would never make our connection! They will not consider using other airlines to complete our travel, will not consider a ICN-BKK-ICN option, and told us, a family of four, to sleep in in the airport for 24 hours and try again tomorrow."
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  When I got to Clark Airport, I asked for an aisle seat near the restroom. I am disabled with mobility problems. The staff assigned me close to the front of the aircraft. I needed to go to the restroom but was stopped and told to walk to the end of the aircraft. I tried to explain to the stewardess that I was placed close to the restroom for my medical needs. The pilot came and told me I will be taken out of the plane. I had no recourse but went to the end of the plane.  I asked for a wheelchair to pick me up. I wouldn’t have minded if the airport staff was told I couldn’t use the business class restroom and then move me to the economy class restroom from the beginning. I’ve used Asiana Airlines several times, a gold member and with this incident, I’m not sure I want to use this airline."
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  One of the most uncomfortable flights I’ve been on. The plane is old, out of the late 90s. The TV is small, old and square-shaped, it still uses the wired control from the side of the seat, and you have to select a channel which plays only one movie. The flight was so hot that it was impossible to sleep or even nap. I brought it to the attention of the cabin crew twice but nothing came of it. The air conditioning was coming from the middle, so those of us by the window were not getting any air. Very uncomfortable and not worth the price for a full-service airline."
Asiana Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Amazing service on this airline and consistently great as we flew a few times with them. On time check in, precision boarding and very friendly through out the whole trip even when it gets bumpy. We will fly with Asiana Airlines again as this was the best service compared to Qantas, Emirates, Air France and SAS that we also used. Thank you so much for looking after us on board."
Asiana Airlines,"Not Verified|  I’m devastated. We booked our flights to Japan with Asiana Airlines 11 months ago, via Booking.com. Now 4 weeks from our holiday of a lifetime, the airline has changed its schedule and cancelled our flights offering a refund. Their schedule change meant there was not enough time to make the connecting flight home. Despite running multiple flights on the route between Japan and London, we’re told there are no seats available for same dates. We were offered one flight 4 days later for an extra £600. We’re now left frantically trying to find flights we can afford that work with our hotel bookings."
Asiana Airlines,"Not Verified| Decent seats, okay food, friendly crew, however the best part was the price. Incheon airport is a nice airport to transit at. Overnight flight, easy to sleep."
ASKY Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Purchased ticket direct from Asky Airlines for flights from Abidjan to Nairobi with transfer in Lome. When arrived in Lome we were told the second leg to Nairobi was cancelled, no explanation given. Later staff told us we were being sent back to Abidjan and from there would take a direct flight to Nairobi with Kenyan Airlines. However Asky ground staff didn't have boarding passes or documents for the flight to Nairobi and told us to get our boarding passes at the Keyna Airlines desk in Abidjan. When we asked how to do this when the desk was airside and most people didnt have visas to enter into Ivory Coast. The Asky staff looked dumbfounded. Then they said someone from Asky would meet us in Abidjan and get us through the transfer area. Of course there wasn't anybody there and we (about 20 people in all) spent over an hour arguing with Abidjan airport ground staff and trying to convince them we had tickets to Nairobi. Eventually we got new boarding passes printed and let transfer. Nobody from Asky staff ever turned up. During the whole time in Lome Asky staff kept passing the issues from one staff member to the other, very unprofessional and totally clueless. We arrived in Nairobi 12 hours later. Didn't receive any compensation, not even a food voucher."
ASKY Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| My trip wasn’t planned, it was a last minute thing, had to find a flight going to Bangui in 2 days, only flight available was ASKY, 5 years ago had a horrible experience with ASKY but had no choice but to fly them. Going to Bangui flight was good, flight attendants were great, joyful, easy to talk to, good manners and helpful, I was shocked and surprised but in a good way. Bangui to Lome flight, KP 035 was terrible, same bad experience all back, flight attendants super nasty, bad attitude, bad service, impolite, miserable people. They need to go back to learn how to react with customers! Don’t bring your bad mood to your job! People on the plane are paying customers, they deserve respect. ASKY should do better!"
ASKY Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Both Ethiopian Airlines and Asky Airlines have failed to deliver the services that I paid for. Asky Airlines canceled our flights as we stood at the airport without a single announcement being made. We did not receive an explanation as to why the flight was cancelled and we're provided different explanations from every single person that we spoke with from the airline. I emailed Asky regarding the cause of the cancellation and have yet to receive a response from anyone. Since I had booked my flight directly through Ethiopian Airlines, I called their customer support and somehow the Ethiopian Airlines rep was also unable to get any feedback from Asky Airlines. How is it possible for Ethiopian Airlines to be a strategic partner to Asky Airlines and not know when there's disruptions with their connecting flights or be able to communicate adequately between the two airlines. Even worst, when Asky Airlines tried to reschedule us for the next flight, they went through the entire process of rebooking and generating boarding passes only to come back and tell my wife and I that the plane was full for our rescheduled flights. So after several hours of waiting in Accra Airport we were forced to stay an extra day for the next available flight back to the US. It gets even worst, because the final destination for our new flight is in a different location in the US since the airline doesn't seem to be able to find any other flight options. So now not only do I have the cost of losing a day of travel, but I also have the cost of having to book another flight from the new destination in order to get home. This is absurd!  When my wife and I booked with Ethiopian and Asky Airlines, we thought we would give them a chance to prove themselves despite all of the negative reviews that we had read online. We have learned our lesson and will never fly with either of these airlines again."
ASKY Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  My flight got canceled without any notice and they did not care at all or even apologize. They changed my itinerary and refused to pick up my call on their so call called WhatsApp call Center. This is the worst airline ever, please do not fly with them ever! They have no respect for their clients"
ASKY Airlines,"Not Verified|  Flight was supposed to depart around 10:45 morning apparently the crew was not available and it got delayed by 2hrs. Once the crew arrived they started boarding the flight and after few mins of boarding completion the flight was about to take off they once again returned back. The captain kept us waiting and after 1hr, captain announced everyone must disembark the flight. So during this process nor the captain or Asky management team didn't even turn back to apologise the passenger and no information about alternate arrangement. Their service is outrageous."
ASKY Airlines,"Not Verified|  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I made a transit from Lome to Accra. Dirty, old plane. I was afraid to touch anything onboard. Got to Accra and all 3 of my luggages were missing. 2 came two days later and now with over a week of going to the airport everyday to check, my last luggage is still missing. The company doesn't have anything on their site to report this. The airline service desk at the airport was no help at all. Still haven't heard from them."
ASKY Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Check in with rude staff. Boarding chaotic. On board the food served was utterly inedible - stale bread. Inadequate drink selection. Dirty aircraft, despite it not being that old. Rude cabin staff. Uncomfortable business class seat. Only positive was good ground handling of business class passengers on arrival in Lome."
ASKY Airlines,Not Verified| Very Terrible Experience. I flew with Business Class but yet my luggage did not arrive. Have tried to call the ASKY office but cannot get information. No official communication has been made as to when we will get our luggage. Will never consider flying ASKY again if had an alternative.
ASKY Airlines,"Not Verified|  I flew to Lome from Johannesburg. When l got my bag at arrival in Lome, the luggage wrapping was removed and my bag was damaged. I reported to Asky offices and they requested that I give them my empty luggage for investigating, which I did. They promised to give my feedback before I return as I was in Lome for a week. They never called back. I had to buy another suitcase. I have sent numbers of mails still no response except to acknowledge my query. The staff on board was rude to me, ne got so upset with me for asking her to give me a 2nd cup of tea."
ASKY Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Very disappointing, they are not reliable enough when it comes to luggage management. When checking it from Libreville to Johannesburg i had to take a connection flight from Lome, same airline but they couldn't check the luggage to Johannesburg. I have been instructed to collect the luggage from Lome and check in again to Johannesburg. When arrive in Lome access was dined by immigration visa was required. I reported to the Asky agent in Lome and advised all in order my luggage was sent Johannesburg. Then when I arrived in Johannesburg no luggage was found and was lost in Lome. I had to book a hotel for the weekend as i couldn't do my job without the luggage. I was very unhappy the way Asky handled this issue as i emphasized my luggage was a priority"
ATA Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Istanbul to Tehran. They lost our suitcase with all our belongings. For follow up they refered us to another interim section. Their excuse was: ""It happens everywhere even with famous airlines"". It was really waste of time and money and a bad experience for us. I will never use this airline again."
ATA Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Tehran to Tabriz, and ATA Airlines used an MD-82. The aircraft have seen its better days long time ago. Flight from Tehran to Tabriz was re scheduled one hour later as originally but I got information upfront. Finally there have been another 45 minutes delay as there seemed to be a technical problem. During waiting it becomes very warm as the aircon was not working till departure. The return flight was in time. Seating is very tight especially when aircraft was almost full which was the case on both flights. Crew was friendly but English skills are limited. On both one hour flights they serve a lunch box, banana, juice, chocolate bars. However, when flying in Iran, ATA Airlines is one of the better airlines, there are no better alternatives on this route. Either you use them or take the bus or the train."
Atlantic Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Boarded by air-bridge on an A320N with very good condition, crew was very friendly. Legroom was plenty and seat was very comfortable. We departed on time. Soon after departure they offer free coffee and water, and buy food from a menu. Captain made announcements of the flight path. We had a great experience with them."
Atlantic Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Copenhagen to Sorvagur return. Wonderful experience, many smiles by service team, multiple drink refills, decent in-flight entertainment via own device and very smooth flight into Faroer. An excellent value for money and perhaps one of the last remaining airlines in Europe that treats customers as many did in the past. I got the impression that the team liked their job and were happy to welcome everyone on board. We pre-ordered delicious snacks and very comfortable seats. Flights were on time and a breeze, a perfect start into the vacation and back home."
Atlantic Airways,"✅Verified Review| Copenhagen to Vagar in the Faroe Islands with Atlantic Airways (RC453). A319 aircraft. Friendly check-in, received baggage tag and headed to the gate. Flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin. Nice colors and comfortable seats. Lots of legroom actually - was very surprised. On-time take off and 2 hours to the Faroe islands - soda, water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced. Inflight entertainment was just the flight-map but had my DVD's to watch. Landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain, but the landing was good. Parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet, but that is how it is there. Bags off in a reasonable amount of time. Oveall a very good flight and for the price a good deal."
Atlantic Airways,"I had two flights with Atlantic Airways. Flight Bergen- Faroe Islands and Faroe Islands to Copenhagen one week later. Both flights on time. Comfortable seats, clean aircraft, good food, friendly service. I will flight with Atlantic Airways again with pleasure."
Atlantic Airways,"Copenhagen to Vagar (Faroe Islands), and the Atlantic Airways A319 was still quite new and had the feature of mood lighting (which you don't see on many European short haul aircraft). The cabin layout was very nice. The food was simple, but good : a nice little wrap, salad with fresh salmon, bread and little mini-Rittersport chocolate. Very surprised that only 45 minutes after the meals / drinks service they did a second drink service (a full aircraft on a 2.05hr flight!). The service was friendly and the lady who served me was most charming. A simple short haul flight, but very pleasant!"
Atlantic Airways,"The short journey was very pleasant, the staff were very friendly and the food on-board was excellent. I would recommend them to anyone flying to the Faroe Islands."
Atlantic Airways,I have flown Atlantic Airways numerous times between the Faroe Islands and Copenhagen. The flight attendants are some of the best around and they consistently go out of their way to ensure that passengers have a good experience. The new Airbus is more comfortable than the older planes. The airlines offers free alcohol and above average coffee. Food however is below average.
Atlantic Airways,Small company but very friendly and efficient staff. All passengers treated as business class travelers even though Atlantic Airways only offers one class (economy). Small planes (Bea 146 and Airbus 319) but the comfort is all right for the short trips between Scandinavian countries Faroe Islands and Britain.
Atlantic Airways,CPH-FAE return new aircraft on time friendly and smiling FA snack alcoholic/ non-alcoholic beverage served.
Atlantic Airways,Flew to Vagar Faroe Islands. Smooth flight lasting 2 hrs 15 mins each way. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Seats comfortable and spacious adequate storage space for inflight luggage. Free snacks served as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified|  AtlasGlobal cancelled my flight in December. I received an email in Turkish which I had to translate first. After this I called Atlasglobal for refund, they told me to call Supersaver since I booked my flight  with them. Supersaver tells me they need an authorization code from Atlasglobal before they refund.  So as a passenger this cancellation is my problem and I have to take care of this? Supervaser refuses to call atlas global and they refuse to help me. I have called both parties over 5 times now and no one is listening."
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified| Tehran to Amsterdam via Istanbul with Atlasglobal. Their service was nothing above mediocre. There is no in-flight entertainment at all. Seats are not comfortable, especially in their A321 fleet. They offer good prices but my last flight which was in December got cancelled and a refund was just offered after two months!"
Atlasglobal,✅Trip Verified|  Booked flights with AtlasGlobal after their comeback thinking everything would be fine. Flew to Istanbul no problem. I arrive at the airport for my return flight being canceled and zero help from the AtlasGlobal staff in finding a new flight. I was told you can file for a refund and how you get home is not up to us. I ended up spending 600 dollars on a one way flight back to Paris on top of what was supposed to be 300 dollars for my round trip flight. They have not responded to my emails.
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified|  Amsterdam to Tehran via Istanbul. The worst experience ever. My flights were canceled with no alternative flights offered in two of the cases. Two of my flights were canceled just 48 hours prior to the flight.  Buying new tickets for the same dates costed me 400 EUR extra! Despite several attempts to get more information on when I will be reimbursed, to date, I have no clue, 3 weeks after the canceled flight date. Several emails sent with no response back yet. Unbelievably poor customer communication. In one case I received a single Turkish only email 48 hours prior to my flight."
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified|  Yerevan to Paris via Istanbul. They cancelled my 2 flights without any information or explanation. I had to buy new tickets to come back home and the company is not answering to my  mails. I need to recover 200 euro, and no one answers. The form on the website of the Company doesn't work, the company I succeed to contact by phone in the country I should have left, gave me indications to contact the customer care, what I already did, with no success."
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified| Yesterday we had flight from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Both flights had delay of about an hour, but it can occur with each company. But companies usually inform us that there is delay for the next flight and no necessity to run to next fly. We ran from security gate to gate D7 in Istanbul Airport and waited there for the next half an hour for boarding. On both flights Atlasglobal removed the head pillows from the seats and it was almost impossible to sit there. The meals were more than basic, but not terrible like seats. Not any entertainment."
Atlasglobal,"Not Verified|  Stansted to Ercan via Istanbul. I booked my flight then checked reviews, most of which hadn't been complimentary. My experience of flying with Atlasglobal for the first time was entirely positive. Unlike most other budget airlines I had 20 kg baggage allowance and basic food and drinks were served on each leg of my journey at no additional cost. One flight attendant in particular deserved a special mention on the Istanbul to Stansted leg of my trip from Ercan on Sunday morning 26/05/19. she was genuinely helpful and very friendly. She literally greeted everyone getting on and departing the plane with a sincere nice smile."
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified|  Istanbul to Paris. They charged us for a sport item that weighs two kilos, USD100. When we looked for alternatives they made excuses, they just wanted to charge us the extra. A shame, we made 12 flights with the same suit and they were the only ones that charged. Nos cobraron por un palo de deporte q pesa dos kilos, USD100. Cuando buscabamos alternativas se reian y ponían excusas, solo querian cobrarnos el extra. Una vergüenza, hicimos 12 vuelos con el mismo palo y fueron los unicos q nos cobraron, y encima 100 DOLARES US."
Atlasglobal,Not Verified| Beirut to Istanbul. They canceled the flight before 2 hours of departure. They never sent explained why. They said tomorrow you can take the flight again at the same time. They kept the people in the airport and they gave people no rooms to stay. Very unreliable airline. I recommend not using their service.
Atlasglobal,"✅Trip Verified|  Istanbul to Bodrum. The flight was delayed at first for 20min and every 20min for 20min more. In the end it was more than 3 and a half hours later until the plane took off. The Atlasglobal staff were coming to the gate one by one and since its a domestic flight I guess they supposed there were no foreign passengers and didnt give any explanation in any language but Turkish. I tried to ask the staff several times for information on the flight but the crowd was huge and everyone was yelling. The explanation was technical problems. The airline doesn't even have any complaint site to ask for compensation, their website in English crashes every time I open it. Extremely badly organised airline with very bad customer relations."
Auric Air,✅Trip Verified|  There are two options for getting from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar – a two-hour ferry journey or a 20 minute flight. The main airlines flying this route are Auric Air and Air Tanzania. Ordering the ticket via Opodo was easy and the airline operates from Terminal 1 – a small building about 1km from the main terminals. Check-in was efficient and the waiting room had several powerful air conditioning units. You could even buy food and drink. Tickets were checked and we were walked across to the Cessna. It had three seats in each row and although tight it was not uncomfortable. It only had a pilot and we flew at about 3000 feet giving us a clear view of the sea and then the island. It ended with a very smooth landing close to the terminal.
Aurigny Air,"✅Trip Verified| Sat here at the airport with a 6 hour delay, they do not provide water as per IATA guidelines, the staff are rude, unprofessional and lack knowledge of airport rules and regulations, when I asked the staff with aircraft authority the airline operates under, EASA or UK CAA they didn’t know. It’s an absolute shower and I would strongly recommend that you travel via ferry or swim, it would be faster and the experience superior, disgusted with the airline and the airport, stay away."
Aurigny Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Reliability at this airline has plummeted since 2022. As a regular user of the “service” I now experience frequent cancellations, and am aware of passengers being bumped off planes. The small fleet is overstretched and so the cascade effects of prolonged maintenance or any crew unavailability are significant."
Aurigny Air,Not Verified|  I haven’t boarded just yet. Flight was cancelled by the airline. Been really looking forward to the flight as I’m visiting my family that I don’t get to see that often. What’s shocking is that in order to change the ticket I need to pay even though airline is the one who cancelled the flight and customer service is not available. On the phone queue for 3 hours already and no answer. I’m lost for words. Is there anyone at all who is willing to help or we just cash in these days! Disappointed is just understatement!
Aurigny Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to Guernsey on an ATR 72. This is a small plane, very small. So small in fact I banged my head upon entering the cabin. I'm 6ft tall and couldn't stand upright, seating was okish, the seat was comfortable enough but legroom was very restricted. Cabin crew were friendly enough and the flight was fairly short, around 45 minutes. Guernsey to Gatwick on an Embraer 195. This is a bigger aircraft, legroom was a little better but the seat was considerably more uncomfortable. Cabin crew were a little surly and again the flight was short, 30 mins, and uneventful. Aurigny, I believe, are the only airline that flies to Guernsey from the UK, so having a monopoly they aren't too concerned with customer service. BA, to my surprise, gave complimentary hot drinks and a breakfast bar on their Belfast city - Heathrow route. Aurigny charge £2.50 for a small cup of basic tea/coffee and if you want a breakfast bar or muffin with that the price rises to £3.50. Now consider that my BA ticket cost less than Aurigny. If another airline starts flying to Guernsey then they might start giving out complimentary hot drinks, until then they will continue to gouge the customer."
Aurigny Air,"Not Verified|  Flown this route return 4 or 5 times. Of course, a visitor to Guernsey has no choice, the airline has a monopoly. The flights themselves were only an hour, and uneventful. Aurigny flight team is usually OK. Not rude, but not terribly friendly, either. My last trip, the Guernsey airport staff was a very bad dream. They treated me like a suspected terrorist (I'm a past-middle-aged solo female traveler.) Kept me until the plane was completely boarded. I was the last one allowed on board. They opened my suitcase and removed every single item. They turned my book upside down and flipped the page, looking for who knows what. I fully expected sniffer dogs at some point. Since the trip itself had been stressful (horrendous weather, hotel room robbed), this last insult was so upsetting! I was finally allowed on the plane, but fighting tears. The flight attendant was nasty and gave me a ""look"" for holding everyone up."
Aurigny Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to Guernsey booked for late April. I am a US citizen who planned to vacation in the UK. With the Coronavirus, we had to cancel our plans. Every business that we preplanned and prepaid with has refunded every dollar even-though all our tours were labeled “non refundable“. Delta also refunded every cent! Aurigny, is the only exception. They told me use my travel insurance because they are not giving me a refund. Can you believe at this time, with this world pandemic emergency situation that this airline refuses a refund. Its not like I merely just changed my mind. Im not allowed to get to UK to take this flight from this airline."
Aurigny Air,"✅Trip Verified| Aurigny has a monopoly on flights in Guernsey so you have no other option that to book with them. The staff on board the flight look miserable, like they do not enjoy working there at all. The checkin staff at Gatwick were ok but the checkin at Guernsey was bad, such grumpy staff. We were 2kg over on checkin which was quoted as going to cost 20pounds! We only had 3 carry-on bags (out of our limit of 4) and the plane wasn't full, so common sense would say just let it through. Instead we had to take the 2kg out and make a 4th carry-on bag. So the weight is still in our entitlement but what a pain! Then on arrival to Gatwick our brand new expensive Samsonsite suitcase had a huge gash on the front of it! I was shocked. There was no person at the baggage info desk at Gatwick (South Terminal). So when I got home and had a customer feedback email from Aurigny, I answered it straight away and told them about the problem. I got no response. I emailed Aurigny again after I returned home from my holiday only to be told: ""The online Survey that is sent out does not come from Customer Services. All claims have to come to this email address, and we have checked, and we definitely didn’t have any emails from you until yesterday. I’m afraid on this occasion we would have to recommend claiming through your travel insurance."" To say that I am disappointed in this service is an understatement. I sincerely hope I have never have to fly on Aurigny ever again, nor would I ever recommend the airline! take the ferry from the mainland or fly to Jersey with another airline and then transfer to Jersey via ferry!"
Aurigny Air,✅Verified Review|  The flight was scheduled from Leeds Bradford to Guernsey at 14.15 on Monday 13 February and was cancelled once we had checked in baggage. No reason was given but we were bused to Manchester where we boarded an alternative flight at 1915. It was notable that there were no adverse weather conditions and regular travellers on the flight indicate that cancelling the Leeds flight is a regular occurrence in order to fill the Manchester flight - this seems a method of marketing the Manchester flight! Surprise surprise the Leeds Flight was also cancelled on Monday 20 February!
Aurigny Air,"We flew from Gatwick to Guernsey and no problem with hold baggage or cabin baggage. However, on our return, at Guernsey check in, our cabin baggage didn't fit in their tester 'box' (despite being bought as hand baggage size), so we had to take out the laptop, iPad and sat nav and put into a carrier bag. Other people were checking in with much larger rucksacks and hold-all whose owners weren't even asked to test if theirs fitted the tester box! If our bag was too large, then fair enough, the measurements were on the Aurigny website but where's the consistency and why wasn't it picked up in Gatwick? Not happy when all we can see in departures are massive 'hand baggage'!"
Aurigny Air,"✅Verified Review| Norwich to Guernsey with Aurigny Air. Online service very good, when I was booking my seats 2 months after booking the flights I noticed I had spelt my wife's name incorrectly, but 1 email to aurigny put that right with no extra charge. The flight to Guernsey from Norwich was on time and landed early, the same when coming back. The flight had 36 people coming back so about 80% full, complementary drinks are served which made a nice change. The flight crew kept us informed through out the flight. I would recommend this airline."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   I have flown yesterday with my pet in business from Vienna to Larnaca and have never seen such behavior/customer service from an airline staff. I have been using Austrian Airline for the past 30 years and never came across such rude, inhuman behavior towards me and my puppy, I wish Austrian Airline can teach their staff to be more kind and understanding when a passenger take his support dog with and not treat them like a baggage. She didn’t even let me give water in the three hours to the dog. She kept raising her voice to keep the dog in the cage (which he was) but no water unbelievable behavior for the manager, very disappointing. I understand that there are rules and regulations and I bought the right cage for the 6 kg puppy but this kind of behavior I have never seen. I paid high price for this ticket and received zero customer service. On top of that I requested a wheel chair and no one would help me get out of the plane."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   In January 2024, we purchased roundtrip air tickets on Austrian Airlines (AA) from Dulles Airport outside DC to Vienna, Austria. We were supposed to fly to Vienna on April 29, 2024. The day before our flight, I received an email from AA announcing that our flight had been cancelled and AA would make alternative arrangements for us. I called AA quickly to make those arrangements. I made a new reservation for us on the same flight for the following day. I didn’t change our return flight in October. AA allows international passengers to check in two days before their flights. So, about 40 hours before our October return flight, I tried to check in. I tried numerous times but kept getting an error message. Our reservation appeared on my AA web account and on my AA App but I couldn't check in either on my laptop or on the AA App. I called AA’s customer service at least three times during the two days before our return flight. They informed me that AA was having technical difficulties with its computer systems and that we should arrive early to the Vienna airport to check in there. On the date of our return flight, we arrived at the Vienna airport about two hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We tried to check in at the self-service kiosk and an AA representative offered to help us. With her assistance, we tried to check in three times, all without success. She escorted us to the baggage service counter where she told us another representative would be able to help us. The woman at the baggage counter was able to find our reservation but not our tickets. She made some calls but was unsuccessful. After about fifteen minutes, she directed us to the Austrian Airlines ticket counter. We spent the next 70 minutes or so at the ticket counter working with three Austrian Airlines agents, one of whom was the manager. The first woman also said she found our reservation but not our tickets. She said she couldn’t give us our boarding passes without our tickets. Her first solution was for us to purchase one-way tickets to Washington DC. I told her that was ridiculous; that we had already paid for roundtrip tickets and would not pay for more tickets. She said that when Austrian Airlines rebooked us in April on our flight to Vienna, AA had cancelled our return flight and had given us refunds of $66.90 each to convert our two round trip tickets to one-way tickets. I scoured my credit card statements and I found the Austrian Airlines refunds in my June statement. However, I never received an email from Austrian Airlines notifying me of a refund for a roundtrip to a slightly less expensive one-way trip. And, because AA had downgraded us from premium economy to regular economy from our cancelled to our rebooked flight in April, I thought any refund was to compensate for that downgrade. The manager of the ticket office was the only Austrian Airlines representative who actually listened to me. She agreed that it made no sense for our allegedly cancelled reservation to remain on my AA web account and on my AA App. She had added that we had done nothing wrong. The manager told us that this was the only time in her 23 years at Austrian Airlines that this had happened to any passengers. She told us she would figure out how to fix it. It took her another 20 minutes or so but she finally called us over to collect our return flight tickets to DC. She said she was unable to seat us together."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Me and my family were excited about traveling on Austrian airline for the first time but the made our complete trip both way a nightmare full of disappointment. On our way from Houston to Amman we missed our flight from Amsterdam to Vienna and was rerouted to two trips instead of one and delayed 15 hours, when we got to Amman our luggage was not on the plane and we waited for 3 days to get it when we got it 4 suitcases were damaged. On our return trip they cancelled our flight and rebooked for 15 days later we end up extending our house rental, car rental phone line, long distance charges over $850 ( I spend over 10 hours on the phone trying to rebook our cancelled flight) and my children missed ten days of school, on our way back we again missed our flight from Vienna to to Frankfort due to the delays by Austrian Airlines from Amman to Vienna, we end losing 17 hours, I wrote to the Austrian Airline to compensate me at least for the house rentals and car rentals and phone charges close to $1900,  they refused to send any compensation and send me a letter asking me to consider them for my future flights, this is the worst company with the worst customer service. I am beyond frustrated and upset."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   No advance information that flight OS738 is not operated by Austrian. At boarding a Braathens ATR72 was waiting. The standard size carry-ons don't fit into the overhead storage and have to be dropped at the plane. An information sheet from Austrian is the only indication of being in the right plane. The flight was smooth, even at 6000 meters with bad weather during the last third. The noise-level was relatively low permitting conversation and the Swedish crew very professional. The usual water bottle and chocolate was served. No other service offered. However, upon on-time arrival the plane is not able to use the passenger boarding bridge and heavy rain when picking up the carry-on resulted in soaked luggage and soaked passenger, giving a new meaning to wetlease as done by Austrian."
Austrian Airlines,"Not Verified| I booked this flight for $12k but booked the return flight out of the wrong airport. Called to change my return from Budapest to go out of Prague and was told they had to do something in their system to ""unmarry"" the flights and call back in 24 hours. 2 months later, 16 phone calls and over 20 hours they finally unmarried the flights. Since it took so long, and the flight I wanted from Prague was nearly sold out, I bought two tickets thinking once they unmarried and reconnected the flights I would get reimbursed since I'd already purchased a full price fair from Budapest. The airline refuses to A. speak with me on the phone (though I've been told five times I would get a call back, I never have) and B. refuses to refund any portion of the added flight I had to book because of their incompetence. They truly could not care less about their customers."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| My flight from BRU to VIE was cancelled a few hours before departure. We got a flight 4 hours later with a stop in Frankfurt. Coming back they told us we had to fill in an online form and would get back the money after a week or so. After first mail we received directly an answer that our tickets would be reimbursed, but after four months, a lot of phone calls and mails later, we still haven't seen our money. The customer service is horrible and really unfriendly. If there is any other company, even more expensive, take it, because the stress with Austrian is just not worth it."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   The night before departure, I received an email from Austrian Airlines asking me to check in my hand luggage because the flight was full. This, I definitely didn't do. It was a completely full flight. The flight was also on time. At checking at Vienna Airport, they expect you to print out your luggage tag and put it on your hold luggage. Legroom was very tight and the seats didn't recline - I had more legroom when I flew Wizz Air. Only a free glass of water and a small chocolate was served for this 3.5 hour flight. Overall, this flight felt like a cheap discount airline. I would fly Austrian Airlines again, though, because you can be assured that the first flight in the morning should be on time as it is the national carrier and flying from Vienna airport. Austrian Airlines European route services are a mirror image of your typical discount airline."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| My flight took off late from PVG and left me with only one hour of transit time at VIE. However, the VIE-AMS flight was also delayed (by about 1-1/2 hour), and thus allowing me ample time to catching this second leg and even using the lounge. Nevertheless, my checked luggage did not make it on the delayed flight (OS375) from VIE to AMS and was put on a later flight. Though the whole incident was not reported to me either at the gate or via the active APP on my phone. Upon arrival at AMS, I waited for more than an hour before reaching their service partner (i.e. dnata) inquiring about my checked luggage and it was then reviewed to me that the luggage was delayed. Not acceptable. The original flight was to arrive in AMS at 7:15pm, and after the luggage fiasco, I didn't leave the airport until well after 10:15~10:30pm. Not one word of apology was uttered by the ground service agent nor the airline even though I am a Star Alliance Premier Gold member. I cannot accept this as a way to treating a frequent flyer. Furthermore, enroute PVG-VIE, service on board was minimal. I rang the service call bell for 20-minutes (turning it ON and OFF a few times) to ask for a bottle of water for my medication. Not answered. I wouldn't even want to imagine what if I was having medical emergency. Scary thought. Food served for Premium Economy was mediocre at best. The friend rice (if you could call it that) lacked substance, taste, flavor and simply cheap-food."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Worst airline I’ve ever flown on,  Austrian Airlines flight was delayed by 1hrs, causing me to miss original flight, and they lost my luggage in the process. No one is accountable for anything, no one can give an answer, no one gives a damn. You on your own."
Austrian Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Worst airline I ever traveled with, I don’t recommend this airline to anyone, they cancel your flight at the last minute, they don’t care about customer service, so rude. Dirty, old, poor service, nasty seats with broken pieces inside."
Avelo Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   My SO and I had booked a round trip with Avelo from Wilmington DE to San Juan PR July 20 -July 24 2024. With departure from San Juan on 07/24 at 2:05pm. The flight down was as smooth as one could expect from a low cost airline. The return was an entirely different story - after repeated delays regarding a maintenance issue, we were told a plane would be arriving by 6pm from Florida to take us back. We saw the crew leave and the plane towed and no replacement flight. Text message received at 6:59pm from Avelo to all passengers stating ""Unfortunately, we will not be able to re-crew your flight...flight has been delayed until tomorrow 07/25/2024 at 6:30 AM."" The desk agent was nowhere to be found to provide additional details. We had been offered a $15 meal credit per person earlier - nearly impossible to find anything at the airport for $15, Then another text stating ""Please submit receipts for any reasonable expenses to[email protected]. Avelo will reimburse you for up to $150 per reservation for a hotel tonight."" I quickly found the cheapest hotel in proximity to the airport for just over $300. Everyone on the flight of almost 200 passengers were scrambling to find hotel rooms. The next morning the flight took off - never an apology for the delay. The flight staff never circulated in the cabin and never offered a drop of water or signature bag of plantain chips - nothing. One passenger told us he had gone to the galley to get water and the crew was sleeping. Once home, I dutifully submitted my reasonable expenses for hotel, uber rides and meal for my SO and myself. I was reimbursed less than 1/2 of out of pocket cost for the delay. Customer service, upon inquiry, informed me that hotel was only authorized for up to $150 per reservation. I penned a letter to the CEO, Andrew Levy, to voice my complaint and request reimbursement for all expenses. No response. So, I do not recommend Avelo, not only did they jerk us around all afternoon we expected to fly, they inconvenienced everyone with the incredibly delayed flight and refused to fully reimburse for passenger expenses as a result of their issue."
Avelo Airlines,"Not Verified|   My flight was canceled on the day I was supposed to travel, they gave us a number to contact customer service to cancel, reschedule or obtain a refund. When I contacted them, the only option they offered me was to refund the money for the outward and onward trip will came to credit it for a next trip within a year, well, they returned the correct amount of the lost flight, but they incorrectly credited me the remaining money, I paid $408.00 in total, they refunded me $197.00, the remaining balance is $211.00 and they only credited me $128.00. What's the trick, they are going to charge me a fee for a problem with the airline that decided to cancel my flight, I hope this is just a mistake and they will credit me with the remaining money. Again they destroyed my vacation plan, (car reservation, hotel room, restaurant reservation in advance with 50% at front, rides paid in full ) they offered to reschedule the next day at 2:00 pm basically arriving around 5:30 , loosing 2 entire days of my vacation and a lot of money in reservations made in advance) worst airline ever."
Avelo Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Booked Avelo Airlines for a trip to Orlando last year. Due to unforeseen circumstances we were forced to cancel our vacation. When I requested a refund they refused to refund the amount back to my credit card, instead issued me Travel Funds. 13 months later I was booking a flight for a vacation and intended to use those Travel Funds only to learn that they expired after 1 year. Literally tried using them 1 year and 1 month and they refuse to let me use the money I paid them for a flight. Avelo basically stole almost $900 from me. I've never heard of a refund expiring. And everyone we spoke to at Avelo was extremely unhelpful and rude."
Avelo Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Avelo does not honor baggage damage claims! When we arrived in Tampa, we noticed that our luggage had been damaged with a major dent and hole. Within an hour we filed an online claim. We waited a whole week to get a response and did not hear anything until August 2 the day after we returned home. The email stated that since we did not respond to their last two emails they were closing our claim. I responded to them that this was the first email I had received from them and that I check my emails hourly. Melissa, their representative, stated that 2 emails were sent one on 7/26 & one on 7/30. I told her that I checked through all my emails junk, sent, and trash and there were no emails from Avelo except for the one that we received on August 2. They are refusing to honor this claim."
Avelo Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  What was a an already stressful time Avelo made it worse in every way. I arrived in New Haven Tweed on Friday, July 19, 2023. I was set to return Sunday, July 21, 2023. I arrived to the airport at 10:30 am (confirmation #YWL6PP). I didn't have any bags besides a carry on and car seat for my 1 yr old traveling with me. The Avelo Staff moves very slow and are very unhelpful. Went through the TSA pre check then off with my shoes and bag threw the scanner. At that moment the computer or scanner went down. No one apologized and no even explained what was happening.  No type of urgency or care in the world. Everyone walking around unsure of their job description. Which held up me for a good while. Well, to my dismay the flight took off without! And I wasn't the only one at least 6 people were in my position. Feeling very upset and discouraged. I call customer to see if they could help me with getting the next flight. I apologize I didn't get a name. Yet, this woman was very rude and mean. She made me feel even worst on what turned out to be a bad day. No help at all. Telling me I was a no show so there is nothing she could do and this is literally right after I missed the flight. And she practically told me it was my fault be there 2hrs ahead. Then hanging up. So I went back to a family members home. Had to make my next move the best move. So after I searched for another flight leaving that night and I had no luck. Then purchased a ticket for Monday. Arrived very early so I wouldn't miss another flight. Once more made I asked about the car seat I was instructed to Gate Check it. There was nothing placed on the car seat but a purple tag with my last name and flight number. So I make it through TSA precheck. Place bag on scanner belt. At this point I'm being advised that I would be searched cause powder was found in my daughters car seat. Yet, couldn't be sure what the substance. Now, I'm being searched in front of everyone as if I'm a criminal.  Then I get my stuff proceed to Gate 2. I was then advised leave my car seat at the bottom of the ramp. I gave it to a Airport Employee. I boarded my flight. I arrive in Atlanta as I exit the plane I see a man with another flyers stroller at that I asked about my car seat I was told pick it up at baggage claim. Walk all the way to baggage claim and my car seat never comes. Then walk over to over sized looking for my car seat and nothing. I walk to the Avelo counter and no one is there to aid me in the loss of my car seat. At this point I feel broken and really disappointed with Avelo in a whole. I really don't ever want to fly with you again. So I call customer and I am advised on what to do. I am woman flying with a 1 yr old child. Things could've been made easier or a little smoother in assisting me. It was my first time using this Airline and It will be my last!"
Avelo Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| I could not have been happier with this airline !It is a no-frills flight. You can ask for a bottle of water if you want. The plane was on time clean fully staffed with pleasant people. On our way to New Haven our flight landed 20 minutes early and on our flight back to St. Louis our plane landed 30 minutes early. The seats were comfortable and honestly, I didn’t miss the free soda or cookies that you can get on more expensive flights. I don’t understand why people are giving this airline bad reviews. We were three adults and two kids Who were flying for the first time and the flight attendants could not have been nicer to them! I will definitely use this airline whenever possible the price is amazing and the service was great!"
Avelo Airlines,"Not Verified|   Horrible experience, delayed departure leaving, delayed departure returning multiple times, we were sent back and forth in the Orlando airport because the gates changed so much, arrival time was 3 hours later then booked, delaying and inconveniencing the passengers. I wrote an email to customer service about multiple grievances, all went ignored and unanswered. It’s unprofessional. Doubt I’ll ever use this airline again if they cannot operate or answer their concerned customers. Avelo should respond to customer emails"
Avelo Airlines,"Not Verified|   This was the absolute worst flying experience I have ever encountered. There was not a terminal selected until 15 minutes before the doors closed, so due to this unprofessionalism I was strapped for time once I figured out where to go. The gate was prompted on the monitor at 12:40 and the doors closed at 12:55 for the 15 minutes before take off at 1:10. As I arrived the door was still open and they shut it while watching me approaching and waving. There was also another customer there that supposedly arrived ""one minute before me"" that they decided to reopen the door for her and allow her in while I was standing there. The staff were just about as rude as any flight staff I have ever dealt with. Then, to get a refund, I was on wait for one hour and 23 minutes to get an Avelo credit, who would want that, instead of a refund on my credit card. This is the absolute worst airline ever! I'm very disappointed that the Greenville, SC airport has made such a bad decision bringing this airport to its community. Not worth the savings!"
Avelo Airlines,"Not Verified|   We traveled Avelo Air and we noticed that they let everyone take their carry-on luggage with them from RDU to ROC. However, when we were bringing the same carry-on bag. We got stopped at the gate and were asked to pay $65 as the carry-on bag had the wheels which doesn't fit their limit. We were forced to pay and that is the rip-off as the same carry-on bag was allowed. We will never fly with them again. Oh, btw they don't even offer cup of water in the plane."
Avelo Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  First of all that Airport is entirely too small to load all of its passengers going to a major city airport.  My luggage was sent to the wrong airport because while the plane was boarding I was still going thru security and missed my flight my went to another airport and because I missed my flight and they won't be held responsible for sending it to me. Not only will they not send it, but at this moment the luggage can't be found. I don't know which airport it's at nor do they. They have no reps at any airport that would be available to help me in a baggage claim department. I've corresponded several times via email and it has taken at least 72 hrs each time I reached out to get an answer regarding this situation. I have medicine in my luggage that is needed and I can't even speak to a live person. The staff is very rude and unhelpful. I am one of many who missed their flights on that day and had to pay out of pocket to catch another flight going a farther distance. For your own sake think twice before flying Avelo. Experience will not let me do it again."
Avianca,"Not Verified|  I recently traveled business class with Avianca from JFK to Bogotá to La Paz, expecting a premium experience, but I was sorely disappointed. For an airline claiming to offer a business class, the lack of lie-flat seats on the JFK - Bogotá leg was shocking and uncomfortable. Sitting upright for hours in what's supposed to be a premium cabin was incredibly frustrating, especially on a long-haul international flight where a bit of comfort should be a given. But the issues didn’t stop there. During the Bogotá to La Paz leg, the service went from bad to worse. Basic amenities were missing — no blankets offered, even with the cabin feeling cold and uncomfortable. To top it off, they didn’t even offer a simple cup of coffee for free. Instead of attentive, thoughtful service, the cabin crew appeared rushed and indifferent, with little concern for the passengers’ comfort. It felt more like an economy-class experience, certainly not the premium touch you'd expect when booking business class. Overall, Avianca's business class on this route felt misleading and frustrating, lacking the comfort, service, and amenities that are typically standard in business class. For those considering paying extra for an upgraded experience, be warned: it’s simply not worth it with Avianca."
Avianca,"Not Verified| Very poor class Airline. Doesn't even provide complimentary water! Everything costs, and on the menu they mark up the exchange rate in US Dollars. No onboard entertainment or WIFI that works or gives you any options to buy or text. Some of the staff are rude! The flight fares may be a little lower than Latam and others, But they charge you exorbitant high prices for the carry-on bag and check bags. I carry-on bag cost $120 one way! That's ridiculous! And then when we got to San Francisco we had to wait 45 minutes before our bags came out and we were the only ones in the international baggage area. Don't fly on this airline!!!"
Avianca,"✅Trip Verified|   We booked and paid for ""business class"" seats on the flight from La Paz to Bogota to Miami back in January of 2024. ""Business class"" is more like economy plus (at best) with the middle seat blocked. In any event, when we went to check in we were told that there was a ""problem"" with our payment and that our seat selection had been cancelled. When I produced documents showing acceptance of my payment, and my ticket with the assigned business class seat, the story changed and ""somehow"" Avianca had cancelled out seats and given them away to another customer while retaining our $75 per person seat fee. Therefore, we learned at 1:00 AM that we had no assigned seat on the 3:15 AM flight! The gate agent informed us that no business class seats remained and put us in a regular economy row with no middle seat between us, as the best he could do. Somehow, on the same transaction, they managed to assign us the exit row seats we had paid for on the Bogota to Miami leg of the journey. Of course I notified Avianca on our return for the $75 per person refund, and they have yet to respond. Since I charged the tickets (of course!) I am also disputing it with the credit card company, and if Avianca does not respond to them by a certain date, the amount will be refunded to us. In this case it is not the amount so much as the sheer incompetency of Avianca. I have never heard of anyone having upgraded seats cancelled on one leg of a flight with no real explanation except ""something happened"" and of course, no subsequent communication from the airline. We were limited in choices flying out of La Paz, but if there is a next time I will take my chances on Boliviana. Most unpleasant any time of day but the worst on a 3:15 AM flight!"
Avianca,"✅Trip Verified| In the competitive Colombia-Europe route, Avianca fails to hold up to other airlines’ prices, services, and overall customer service. An overbooked flight made a rocky start for AV26 to Madrid, in which there was somewhat of a brawl between airline staff and passengers who had the misfortune of being randomly selected to be offloaded and rebooked in AV10, a flight which departed around 6 hours later. Anyway, I was lucky to get to keep in the crammed seat that I had payed for, and although the 787 is a comfortable plane, avianca’s recent densification of the plane means that legroom is painfully tight for me (182 cms) and padding is practically nonexistent. In other words, getting up from the seat is a pain, but so is staying on it! Food was exceptionally dreadful (like 80’s bad) and the crew also went out of their way to be as rude and unfriendly as they possibly could. Either the call buttons are broken, or nobody bothers to go see the passenger in need of something. Avianca is unable to compete with Lufthansa, Iberia, AirFrance, KLM and even AirEuropa on any aspect of their service, so I would only choose them if they were very the cheapest option, though the case is normally the opposite - and they are the most expensive."
Avianca,"✅Trip Verified| I’m sitting here in a seat I paid extra for, with my back totally against the wall the seat and my knees smashed by the person front of me. I can’t move. My seat doesn’t recline. Why did this seat cost extra? Why is this airline so horrible? This is simply an unacceptable way to treat people."
Avianca,"✅Trip Verified|   I am an Avianca star alliance gold member. Over the years, I have seen previously good service decay into mediocrity. But today was different. I’ve had enough, and am now looking looking for status match options with competitors. Today, booked from Orlando to Bogotá in “Flex” (Avianca’s most expensive fare for this specific route/ $620 round trip/ 3.5h flights), I was greeted by some extremely rude staff at Avianca’s check in at Orlando Airport. Although, thanks to my Star Alliance Gold (Avianca Diamond) status I have a complimentary sports equipment, for the first time ever, I was ordered to open the wakeboard’s case and show it. Afterwards, I was told that, due to the fact that in the wakeboard’s case there also were a couple of damp swimsuits, this was no longer considered a sports equipment and therefore would be charged as an oversized bag ($100). In order to comply with the rude employee’s nonsensical and ridiculous requirement that there only fly the sports equipment within the case, I asked her to check it in. At that point she stopped again, this time to take out a measuring tape and ask me for the $100 oversize fee anyway, as the wakeboard exceeded allowed measurements by about two inches. After asking for some rationality, I was insulted by the supervisor, threatened to have my reservation canceled, and forced into oblivion. Upon boarding, even in the Star Alliance Gold line, me and my fellow frequent flyers were barked at by another equally rude employee into measuring our luggage in a low cost airline-style fitter. After my “personal item” (an average sized backpack) barely exceeded the allowed measurements and would be of no difference to anyone, as it flies under the seat in front, I was ordered to gate-check it for the hefty fee of another $120. After mentioning, once again my status, the unnoticeability of the excess in size, and the cost of the fare I had purchased, I was told literally that they “couldn't care less” and that, should I not pay immediately, I would be reported as an unruly passenger and be denied boarding. Apart from the absolute antithesis of basic costumer service, the outrageousness of the employee’s blatant lack of respect, and the little to no courtesy Avianca showed towards me and other costumers, I wound up paying $840 dollars for a round trip of 3.5h flights on a painfully uncomfortable economy seat with unnoticeable recline with a blocked middle, and absolutely no complimentary service (even water was charged) and a couple of insults. I have flown low cost airlines extensively both in Europe and the US. I have never had such a terrible experience, let alone for the price and frequent flyer status I hold. I would suggest fellow travelers to go out of their way in avoiding Avianca: If you’ve purchased one of their more “permissive fares” or got frequent flyer status with them or any Star Alliance partner, they “couldn’t care less about it”. And regardless if you have it or not, you’re guaranteed to have an expensive, uncomfortable, and deeply unpleasant travel experience both in the ground and air."
Avianca,"✅Trip Verified| Mediocre airline, in a 5 hrs flight from SCL-BOG-SCL on a A320, there was no inflight service. Only buy menu. Crew was professional but not something special. Both flights were on time. Aircraft was clean and legroom was standard for A320 but not fitted for that mid-range flight. I noticed that the 3 first rows were in 2-2 configuration with a blocked middle seat. It was business class but I think is not worth the U$300 one way upgrade charge. I was thinking of do it but when I saw was was offered I changed my mind. No IFE during the flight. Seat allocation was done by the airline and if you wanted to change, you had to pay extra."
Avianca,"Not Verified| I highly recommend using a different airline. It has been nothing but chaos on my departure flight as well as my return flight. They start boarding 45 min AFTER the departure time, with not room for those with short departures. Currently I am waiting for a flight to NYC because somehow I was able to book a flight through them that doesn't exist. I flew in from Rio on my way back to D.C. and they said the 11:55 departure time I had on my itinerary didn't match the 7:40 AM time on my layover boarding pass. I landed in Bogota at 11 am. How is that even possible that I was able to book one flight but then given another a day later? They didn't even offer to put me up in a hotel. Instead I had to beg for them to at least get me on a flight as close to my destination as possible (NYC). I guess from there, I'm on my own. This is so unprofessional. I would not be writing this review if there was some compassion. Why would anyone want to spend 20-something hours in an airport to no fault of their own?"
Avianca,✅Trip Verified|   They would not let us get on a flight because we were missing a vaccine document. I had refundable fare and was promised by the check in agent if I contacted their help desk within 10 days I would get a full refund. To this day Avianca says I should have done it there before the flight and refuses to refund $2572 except $104. I battled for 6 months with them stating I was working off their employees statement.
Avianca,"✅Trip Verified|   Every step of the way the make the flight as uncomfortable as possible to provoke costumers to upgrade. They purposely have seats that don’t recline at all or have a headrest in economy, bus seats are more comfortable. On the flight I asked for a pillow or blanket to use as cushion on the bench seats and they charge 11$ for that. They don’t hand out any beverages on an international flight at all. No entertainment systems they supposedly have a streaming website but it won’t load, just says server not found. But the worst is the hidden fees. On an economy flight international you apparently have to reserve a 50$ carry on ticket 48 hours in advance. If you don’t they will charge you 120$ at the gate. This is a hidden fee and I didn’t see any hint of this until I was checking in online in the 24 hour window to do so (24 hours to late to adjust the ticket) and if you flight have a layover you have to pay this fee each time. They will not have pity on you and demand the money or offer you to ditch your luggage. Even single step of the way they are trying to get more money out of you. Do not fly this Airline thinking it’s economical because the hidden fees add up fast and you will not actually save money. Buy yourself the comfort of a regular airline. There was even an airport waiting area fee attached to my ticket!"
Avianca Brazil,✅Trip Verified|  Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. Had worst and most stressful experience with this airline. Bought tickets back in November 2018. Then a few times received email about changing flight times. Ok I understand it happens. So turning up at the airport looked on the screen and couldn't seen my flight. Went to customer desk and been told my flight is cancelled! Couldn't believe what I heard as didn't receive email or text about cancellation. Been told get a taxi /pay myself as they don't provide transfers/and rush to another airport and my flight is due in next 2 hours. Stuck in traffic and it was so frustrating I gonna make to this flight too as I had bag to check in too. Luckily came to airport 1h before flight. This airline should be bankrupt long time ago as no customer care at all and they just put they problems on your shoulders!
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified|  Be prepared that you'll be rejected to check-in on the counter without any reasons. They said, that agent had an issue with booking, but it can't be true because couple of months before flight I had a chat with support about buying luggage and they didn't mention any problems with registration. As pointed in other reviews the problems in this airport hard to solve as it doesn't have Wi-Fi and airline staff didn't offer any help. So I was forced to buy new tickets 4 times more expensive than initially."
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified|  Foz de Iguaçu to Rio de Janeiro. After my experience of this airline, it is unsurprising that it is on the verge of bankruptcy. There was an issue over whether we had paid for hold baggage; the picture suggests that we did but, after detailed investigation, it does look as if we did not. However, the staff were incompetent beyond belief: the so-called manager insisted on some sort of number as part of the evidence that we had paid for bags but the airport had no Wifi and we had problems using 3G/4G data. At no point did anybody suggest that we could pay for the luggage and sort out the problem afterwards, something I would have been happy to do. If I had not taken the initiative in suggesting this, we would have missed our flight. One of this ""manager's"" charmless colleagues had the cheek to castigate us for not being able to speak Portuguese at an international airport check-in! Between us, we speak English, Spanish and French but it was apparently OUR fault that the Brazilian education system is woefully inadequate when it comes to foreign languages. Once on board, 30 minutes after take-off, the trolley finally made an appearance. Unbelievably, on a two hour flight, the choice of food and beverages on offer were zero and still water respectively."
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified|  Avianca Brasil is on Chapt11. Due to fly Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro on Monday, connecting from ZRH, they cancelled my flight on their website, but not on AMADEUS. However on Sunday, I succeed in proceeding to web check-in. Slightly stressed, I arrived in GRU, where I had to check my luggage for domestic flight. Counter was more than unpleasant. My Gold status was not recognized, luggage was not tagged with priority sticker, neither any info given about lounge. I was bothering. On the opposite flight crew was extremely kind. Everything went smoothly and on-time. I discovered later that employees wages have not been paid."
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified|  Rio de Janeiro to Salvador. At checkin, my Star Alliance Gold privileges were fully recognized. Boarding was smooth and departure 30 mn late. Food on board extremely limited, but at least free, and served with smiles ! Brand new and clean aircraft. Unfortunately price (>300 US$ vc 65 Usually) was extremely high as the airline took literally profit of year-end demand."
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified|  Sao Paulo to Lima. Friendly and efficient check in process in Sao Paulo. The lounge they offer on Terminal 2 is unfortunately not really great, they have no own lounge and you use the GOL lounge which is really an underwhelming experience, terrible food, old and dated interior, not very friendly staff. Boarding was efficient, staff on board friendly. Food was nothing special. Great was the views from the aircraft! The aircraft is relatively old and dated, but the seats are ok for a 4-5 hour flight (not fully flat)."
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified| Curitiba to Los Angeles via Sao Paulo. Avianca Brazil is horrible! On July 31 I flew from Curitiba, Brasil to Los Angeles, USA. Both of my bags were lost for a week, the customer service was useless, I was told that my bag was coming on Alaska Airlines, when I called them they had no record, but were nice enough to look up my bags on their tracking. I learned that my bags were separated but none were on their way to me. 6 days after this ordeal, my bags were supposedly on the way, but when the representative called to confirm my address she left a number that didn't work. I finally got in touch with the customer service who told me to just wait until they called back. When I asked to speak to the manager, they said only if I would speak Spanish. I said no problem, and then they hung up on me. At this point I am not holding out hope that I will get my bags back, much less before my 10 day vacation is over. I have never had such a horrible experience in my life, but after reading the reviews, I am not surprised."
Avianca Brazil,✅Trip Verified| Bogota to Fortaleza. Beware of this airline. It's not associated in any way to Avianca nor the Star Aliance. I had a flight from Miami to Bogotá before the flight to Fortaleza and Avianca didn't allow me to check my bags all the way to Fortaleza. They told me that Avianca Brazil is an independent company. After arriving to Bogotá I had to pay for the service to watch my bags for some hours at the Bogota Airport. Then I had to re-check my bags. They charged me for the second bag. At the return flight my bag was left at the Bogotá Airport cause I haven't had enough time to get out of immigration and re-check it. Now I have to find a cargo company to bring my bag back to Miami. And I didn't receive my Life miles from Avianca Brazil.
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified| Rio de Janiero to Curitiba via Sao Paulo. Really good experience, really smooth, in-flight entertainment and free food and drink, the cabin crew were really friendly. This really beats European customer service. the leg room is still the same but just the service outweighs it for me"
Avianca Brazil,"✅Trip Verified|  We flew on 11th November from Iguazzu to Rio de Janeiro with Avianca Brazil where we had the worse experience ever. Initially the flight was delayed by one hour but eventually it turned out to be a flight delay of 8 hours and 10 mins, the initial take off time was 11.30 which then turned out to be 7.40pm. This was made worse by a number of issues at the airport and poor staff customer services: Poor communications and updates, no reason given and no idea of when the next flight. It turns out that the plane for that flight was re-directed to do a different route. Staff either refused to communicate or did not know what was going on - keep saying we were going to leave in an hour or 90 mins and it turned out to be 8 hours. we then waited for the crew to come on a later flight that evening to man a plane that was already there to take us back. Inadequate compensation -lunch only provided but vouchers handed out after 4 hours. This was generally poorly organised with long queues from check in desk rather than a different area- this mean people checking in where queuing with those waiting for their vouchers delaying the whole process. Planning to fly a further 7 flights in January and this has been a very bad experience. Poor boarding procedures on flight at 7.40pm."
Avianca Ecuador,"✅Trip Verified|  I travel a lot and have flown with many different airlines but this is the first time I had a Roundtrip with Avianca, and the experience was not great at all. The staff is not the nicest and are simply rude - no customer service skills at all. On my way to the Galápagos Islands, my flight was pretty much empty and a family with a baby wanted to sit together, being that their row was empty, the flight attendants refused them sitting next to each other - where as other airlines do not have a problem with that. Mind you this was all in the same economy cabin, no one was trying to upgrade their cabin, simply just sit next to one another. On my way back from Galapagos, my flight again was not fully packed and in one of the overhead bins, there were many book bags and a small space where I attempted to put my large should bag. There wasn’t space for another book bag or carry on suitcase but there was just enough room for my shoulder bag, to which the flight attendant basically yelled at me for and asked to take it down. 5 minutes later, the overhead bin which I attempted to put my bag in, was closed with no other bags put in. I am dissatisfied with the customer service of this airline. Not even mentioning that they won’t offer you a simple cup of water unless you pay $4. My family traveled from NY to Ecuador, which is a 6 hour flight, they also complained about not even being offered water or a snack. Absolutely ridiculous. I traveled from Colombia to Ecuador which was an hour flight with LATAM and was given a drink and two snacks. Will not be flying Avianca and will be discouraging others from flying with them as well."
Avianca Ecuador,"✅Trip Verified|  I am 5'10, 225 lbs. My knees were crushed by seat in front of me in the upright position. There was no room for my backpack with only documents and cell phone accessories in it under seat in front me. Everyone in seat adjacent to mine were miserable as was i for a long all-night flight. The Air did not work properly blew warm air, if any at all, on a very full flight. No monitor to watch anything, there was no WIFI or it did not work properly there was no charging port for a cell phone or anywhere to plug anything in. They did not offer Water or anything for that matter. It was the worst flight I have ever been on in my life. I will never use this Airline ever again."
Avianca Ecuador,"✅Trip Verified| Their seating arrangement is a joke and represents everything wrong with capitalism. Even though the flight was ""only"" less than 4 hours, your mind projects this discomfort as one full eternity in hell. Nobody taller than 180cm will enjoy the ride, unless they love suffering and narrow spaces. I'm 185cm and my knees kept pushing into the metal parts of the hand rests in front of me (window seat). I was just lucky that there was a much small person sitting next to me that did not need as much space. The moment you put 3 people above 180cm next to each other, it's game over. I don't care about the onboard service because most of the time I bring my own snacks for the journey. I don't care about onboard entertainment for the same reason. I only care about the basic comfort (not even higher echelons of comfort that Karens would be fighting teeth and nails to get) but Avianca fails to deliver even this basic thing. It's honestly sad. If I could choose one superpower for one day, I would choose one that allows me to make all the Avianca board members to take a 4-hour Avianca flight in Economy seats to rethink their lives."
Avianca Ecuador,"Not Verified|  This was the worst airline which we took a flight with. We both got charged for our bags. Weight of both was OK in limit, one of them was by few centimeters bigger, dimensions of other were OK, still got charged."
Avianca Ecuador,"✅Trip Verified|  Worst experience ever. Their system never works, customer service is bare minimum, flights get canceled and you are not informed. I trusted this airline to help me get to Quito for a connecting flight. I missed my flight back home and had to rebook the entire trip."
Avianca Ecuador,✅Trip Verified|  The worst company ever! They overcharge for everything. I booked on there website and it said nothing about different fees for Ecuadorians and foreigners but then they charged me 150$ to fly and said they will charge another 150$ to go back home. The customer service never answers and will not refund me for the money.
Avianca Ecuador,"Not Verified|  Still waiting for a refund from September 2020. Terrible customer service. I am trying to reach out to someone and get help but it is impossible, no body replies to my emails and if you call them, you can not talk with the department in charge of refunds."
Avianca Ecuador,"✅Trip Verified|  Horrible experience, we bought tickets for Galapagos and when me and my family arrived to the check in we were we need to pay 120 dollars more for every ticket (we are a family of 5) because we are not Ecuador citizens. This was not written anywhere on their site/on the ticket/ or while purchasing the ticket. They argued there was a pop up screen when we bought the ticket which is just making no sense and is actually a blackmail. Would not recommend flying with this horrible company."
Avianca Ecuador,"Not Verified|  Charged us an extra $150 per person at the gate. Said we were told and that it was in our confirmation. When we showed them that our confirmation showed nothing we were told that we still owed $300 for the two of us, almost the price of our tickets, even though we showed proof. The people at the counter were rude in explaining and persisting, even though we showed proof that we did not have to pay. It was so bad that We would have cancelled our flight on principle but the rest of our itinerary in the Galapagos was non refundable."
Avianca Ecuador,"✅Trip Verified| Beware of flights from the Galapagos Islands. Because we don't understand Spanish, we bought a ticket on the Avianca English website (because it is in English, I naturally believe, that the site is intended for foreigners). I checked in the day before, add our passports and got the boarding passes. But we didn't know if we should go straight to the plane (because of covid, etc...), we went to the counter. There they told us that they wouldn't let us on the plane, that we had to pay $150 per person because we are foreigners. If they have different prices for foreigners and for locals, OK, but we would like to know when we buy the ticket, agree and pay directly. This seemed to us like blackmail or a scam. ""Don't pay another $150, your ticket will be forfeited, because we won't let you on the plane."" I've never experienced anything like this and I've been flying all my life and very often. And on top of that, the completely unprofessional behavior of the manager, who didn't even want to tell us her name. Because we were 3, it cost us an unexpected $450 more. What more can I say....Avianca never again. The rest of the trip we were flying by LATAM and it was perfect."
Avior Airlines,"Not Verified|  The airplanes are very old, and there's no IFE or WiFi connection. The crew was kind but there are some problems with the people at counter, they don't give the complete information of schedules. The ticket was expensive compared with other countries because they don't offer the prices in Bolivares, only in dollars. But actually it's the best option to travel in Venezuela. The biggest problems in Maiquetia airport are from the immigration and security personal, also the installations are deficient. There's no paper at bathrooms and blackouts are common."
Avior Airlines,"Not Verified|  Miami to Caracas. Terrible experience. Bought a non stop ticket. Upon returning, Avior decided to put 2 flights together and passengers were sent to a different city, we were delayed for over 6 hours, I advised Avior that I had a connecting flight to 2 different agents that advised that they would contact Avior USA, by the time I got to USA, I had lost my connecting flight, spoke the situation to Avior Personnel who not only were extremely rude but refused to pay for my hotel and took no responsibility on the issue. Next day, I tried to contact Avior by phone and email providing all info to no avail. The difference between a non stop ticket vs a stop ticket was over $200-$300."
Avior Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  Caracas to Curacao. Worst company ever. Delay of 9 hours and therefor we missed the flight to Amsterdam and had to buy a new ticket. No announcement was made of the delay. No excuses nothing. I cannot recommend this airline to anybody.
Avior Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  I had the misfortune of flying Avior Airlines from Barcelona (Venezuela) to Miami on 8th  November. Flight was scheduled to take off at 1630 and land at 1910. I had a connection at 2215 in Turkish airlines to Istanbul and then to Singapore. Just before boarding airlines announced a technical snag and announced a delay. I understand that such a scenario is possible with any airline, but what followed was traumatic for me. I asked the ground staff should I cancel my flight to Singapore for which they checked with their station manager in Miami and confirmed to me that, they will make arrangements to put me on next flight under their responsibility. They categorically told me that if I cancel from my end, no help will be extended from their side. Believing them, (should never have) I flew to Miami. Needless to say when I landed I was left high and dry with no one to help, no hotel stay and of course no flight tickets. On fighting with them, the whole day, they came with an excuse that time difference between two international flights should be 3 hour and 30 mins against my 3 hour and 5 mins. When i asked them for IATA rules or their company rules stating the same, they were unsuccessful in producing both."
Avior Airlines,I often fly PMV-BLA-MIA on 9V mostly in Business Class 4-5 times a year. Overall performance has improved a lot compared to 2012 when delays of 2-3 hrs were common. They now use ex-US Airways B-737-400 for their international routes including Miami and Panama-Tocumen. FA's are average or above depends on the crew you got on your specific flight. Food in Business Class is below average but you can eat it. Drink service is way below average only soft drinks and water offered in Business Class. On return flight MIA-BLA they give you Whisky no wine no sparkling water nothing. Check-in in PMV takes an hour or so since they fill out the passenger list for MIA manually. Transit in BLA is quite easy no long walking distances BUT broken escalators for over a year now disgusting. On your return flight you have to claim your luggage in BLA what is kind of funny since there is no luggage belt. Suitcases are thrown through a hole in the wall into bag claim hall. Seating in business class is fairly comfortable (old US domestic first class) in coach very narrow seats low pitch uncomfortable for flights 1 hr or more. No inflight entertainment. Safety briefing in both Spanish and English. Because fares are much lower than on AA or Delta it s my first choice to the US. And when originating in PMV you don t have to go through Maiquetia which is a mess and waste of time.
Avior Airlines,BLA-CCS. Avior are basic but no worse than many European budget airlines. Seats are small but the flight from Barcelona to Caracas is only 30-40 minutes so not much time to feel uncomfortable and there is a free drinks service even on this short flight. There's no real reason not to fly Avior. However the check-in luggage maximum is only 20 kgs so if carrying a heavy suitcase you may prefer flying Conviasa (30 kgs) which is usually a little more expensive but allows more luggage and is usually somewhat more comfortable too.
Avior Airlines,PMV-BLA recently on a Beech 1900 aircraft I can call it an intensive flying experience in this small turboprop plane! Anyhow the cabin appeared to be as a bit filthy and quite dirty. All in all not really remarkable.
Avior Airlines,Again Avior and disapointed but its the only carrier operating between Trinidad W.I. and Isla Margarita. They recently cancelled the operation of the old B732 (except public Holidays and long weekends in Trinidad) into a small 19 seater Turboprop Beech Aircraft. No washroom on this Aircraft and no FA's. The only safety instruction was a lousy tape in Spanish. Only English speaking Trinis on board. Return flight we were told that the flight is delayed from 9am to 12noon (maybe) because of technical problems in Barcelona (Venezuela). Actually the flight came in 2PM and after again 2 hrs we were able to board the flight. The ground staff from Avior was helpful and organized for other passenger to get baggage in the terminal to feed small children and change clothes. We arrived safe back in Trinidad but still worries about the standard and safety of this airline.
Avior Airlines,Trinidad W.I. POS to Isla Margarita (Polarmar). Check in was very convenient at POS Terminal. Avior opened 3 Counter for approx 120 Passenger. All Pax checked in approx in 25 Min. The Aircraft arrived only 20 Minutes delayed because of bad weather. On board the service was above my expectations. Even on this short flight of 45 Min they served a snack and 2 times softdrinks. Avior leased the aircraft with business and econ. configuration but offers only eco class. The AC an older B737-200 was in quite good conditions and boading the AC we had the chance to see into the cargo/baggage holds and got a positive impression. Only situation worries me was the lack of language skills of the cabin crew. During the demonstration of the safety features the lady showed the use of the life vests and the only english skills attendant explained same time the oxygen masks. We believed that she had no clou what her co worker was talking about. Most of the passengers had lots of fun during the bad safety demo but I thought what happens in a case of emergency? Most of the passenger from Trinidad have no spanish skills and wouldnt be able to understand the instructions from the FAs. Returning from Margarita we were shocked seeing the chaotic situation at the Airport. No real information how the system runs. Endless waiting infront of several check points and finally we arrived at the departure gates. Same time Avior departed to POS and SATA to Martinique. No correct information what line is the correct one. At the end they just let all passenger thru and we had to find our way to the AC on our own. No Ground Staff to guide the passenger on the runfield. Finally we departed 1 hr late due to bad co ordination of ground staff and had a quite flight back to Trinidad W.I. Over all the airline is OK and the service much better than other local airlines. Safetywise i would recommend not to travel if ur unable to understand spanish.
Azerbaijan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Offered sandwich and drinks at this very short flight. I love flying on Embraer planes in a short regional flights as they are very comfortable. Staffs were OK both on ground and on board. All in all it was a good flight in terms of schedule, service & ticket price."
Azerbaijan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   The airline staff at Baku airport were not friendly and their mismanagement resulted in missing one of our original flights. They did not bother if we stayed in the Baku airport the next days as the other flights were booked. So, the ground staff charged us double for another closer city (Tbilisi). We used this airline for our summer travels from London to Baku  and Baku to Batumi and return. Overall, we flew four times and were very disappointed with ground staff and old aircraft (e.g. faulty entertainment screens)."
Azerbaijan Airlines,✅Trip Verified| Extremely unfriendly. No smile on the face of the staff. It looked like they were forced to work - a drudgery. They blocked the middle passage with a food trolly for nearly 90 minutes and would not allow a senior citizen to pass towards the lavatory. When he got desperate and a little angry the steward Ahamad shouted at him. The lady staff member would hide he name and when I tried to read it she pointed at the camera and threatened me. The food too was nothing to write home about. The omelet was dry. No in-flight entertainment or wi-fi. Did not get any boarding pass online when I reserved my seat despite giving my cell number and email. Next time I'd rather fly Indigo to Baku via New Delhi.
Azerbaijan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| The cabin was too warm which made this short flight rather uncomfortable, also it was a rather turbulent one. They served a good sandwich with complimentary drinks which in my opinion is a very nice gesture. Legroom was premium as were the seats."
Azerbaijan Airlines,"Not Verified| We had a flight from Dubai to London Heathrow with a 2-hour transit in Baku. Due to the over 7-hour delay from Azerbaijan Airlines in providing the flight to Baku, we missed our next flight which was from Baku to London, and their next available flight from Baku to London was in two days.  After 30 minutes of the departure time, the Dubai Airport staff at the boarding gate informed us that there is a delay but they do not know how long the delay would take and so we should purchase another ticket at the airport. As the next flight from Baku to London was in two days, we had to purchase another super expensive ticket at the airport just to arrive at our destination to be at our work on time. Now, not only they do not refund our first tickets which they could not provide the services for, but they also do not refund the full cost of the new tickets."
Azerbaijan Airlines,✅Trip Verified| I will never purchase a flight ticket from them again as they are irresponsible. Refusing to do a refund now and they're telling me they can't find me in the system. Basically lost my money and voucher because it is expired.
Azerbaijan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  We were planning to fly from London Heathrow to Baku on 20th March 2020 but we had to cancel our flights due to the global pandemic. Azerbaijan Airlines responses is ""Refund can be processed after the regular flights' resumption"" This has been the answer since 2020 and it has been more than 2 years. All  other airlines got back to their normal flights but Azerbaijan Airlines. I totally understand this was an okay excuse in the beginning but after 2 years it cannot be accepted. They cannot hold our money for that long."
Azerbaijan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  We were due to fly from London Heathrow to Baku on 9th July. Our flight for 3 adult tickets was cancelled due to the global pandemic. Azerbaijan Airlines are refusing to refund our tickets and the complaints e-mail is never answered. Our onward flights with Air Astana were refunded in full and they could not have been more helpful, the difference between the 2 airlines is profound I resorted to sending a cross e-mail to all the global offices of AZAL, plus putting messages on Facebook in the vain hope of eliciting some sort of acceptable response but it had no effect."
Azerbaijan Airlines,"Not Verified|  We had a flight booked to Baku for the 4th June and this was cancelled due to Covid-19. We had booked the flight through Expedia along with the hotel. No issues with a refund from the hotel but the airline has been a different story. They advised Expedia that they refuse to offer a refund and have only offered a voucher. We disputed this as unlikely to be flying to Azerbaijan any time soon but again, told this was not happening and we would only be offered a voucher. Our credit card company have got involved and they have been told the same thing. I understand they have a no cancellation policy but surely the exceptional circumstances the whole World are in at the moment should be taken into consideration?!  Not impressed in the slightest and will not be booking with them again!"
Azerbaijan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  My first trip ever on Azerbaijan Airlines from Baku to Istanbul. The fare was surprisingly competitive. The plane was an older A319 with no individual PTV screens, it still had ash trays in the arm rests. But the leg room was generous in economy. The cabin crew was efficient with good English proficiency, but hardly a smile to me. A full dinner was served which was Azerbaijani food and which was delicious. Overall not a bad experience on Azerbaijan Airlines and I would fly with them again in the future."
Azul Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Very disappointing experience. Website not working and hours spent just to buy two luggage ( tickets were quoted with no luggage attached : strange for a long distance flight). Staff at Paris Orly was making a mistake in connecting flight and I could spot it and change in hurry at Paris Orly but my luggage did not follow and were lost. Nobody was helpful in Rio and I had to call and write non stop to collect my luggage. No apologies , no compensation. It is business as usual for them. Do yourself a Favour and never use this company. You will save time , stress and money. In my honeymoon I have other things to do."
Azul Airlines,"Not Verified|   I paid over $3,500 for 2 round-trip tickets. I paid extra to travel on seats with more leg room because my husband has back problems and it was a 8-hour flight. A few days prior to the trip they decided to change the aircraft and said they could not honor the seats I had paid for. Their solution was to give us 2 $56 vouchers. We tried to talk to the lady at the counter in the airport; she said we couldn’t do anything and suggested to call customer service. I did and the representative told me there is nothing he could do. My husband asked to speak to a supervisor who told him that, even though we paid extra, those seats were subject to availability. I paid extra because those seats were available when I booked the flight! They made a change that I didn’t request and they didn’t even give us a decent refund. We traveled very uncomfortable in the tiniest seats, no tv, no WiFi, and nobody could do anything about it. Unacceptable! Worst airline ever!"
Azul Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Be cautious of flight cancellations and inadequate customer support in English. The outbound flight was better than average and entirely acceptable. However, issues arose when the return flight got canceled by the airline. I had no opportunity for compensation regarding my accommodation or Uber expenses. The customer service team struggles with English proficiency, and when submitting required documents via email, the response is cold, stating that It is not acceptable. They don't provide a chance to resend documents or communicate through email; instead, you're directed to initiate a new claim. After multiple frustrating calls, I found that the customer service is unhelpful, and if you seek a supervisor, you're informed, ""Sorry, we have no supervisor who speaks English."" Each response from them takes about 7 days, reiterating, ""It is not acceptable!"" After realizing I was losing more money by following up, I decided to discontinue flying with them. I acknowledge their shortcomings in customer service and cancellation policies. This is an honest review — not out of hate, but as a precaution against potential financial losses due to flight cancellations."
Azul Airlines,"Not Verified| Horrible service. Airline changed airports from Rio Dumont to Rio Galeao and dates of travel from the 26th to the 18th and are unable to issue a refund due to me paying in international currency (CAD). As this was the first leg of my long trip back to Canada, obviously these changes did not work with the rest of my itinerary, and was told there is nothing they can do. Not to mention, extremely difficult to get ahold of and barely any English options available. This airline should not offer international flights. Period."
Azul Airlines,"Not Verified|  Stay well clear of these clowns. They canceled a fully booked flight 2 hours before. No reason. No support. Cost us USD5000 in lost forward tickets. This was Tuesday, the only offered a next flight on the Friday! Manager was absolutely unfazed by our distress and was actually making jokes with his co workers about us. Don't ever fly this airline."
Azul Airlines,"Not Verified| Canceled my flight twice, gave me this gift code to fly with them again which I won’t need because I don’t fly often. Make us get on the plane to wait a long time just to tell us at the end they can’t fly the plane because of technical issues. It’s so annoying and I’m tired. They should be running tests on these planes before boarding. It does not make sense to get everyone comfortable just to cancel on them."
Azul Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Was traveling for business with my colleague. He is claustrophobic. We had the front row seats. A few minutes after we sat he started having a panic attack and got up and ran out of the plane. He did not want to fly and that would have messed up all our travel plans and business meetings schedule. To make a long story short the 2 flight attendants: Elvis Souza and Paula Maia saved the day. They managed to step out of the plane on the ground and spoke calmly with my co-worker and managed to relax him and calm him down and also, cleared a double seat for him and somehow managed to bring him back into the plane (no passenger next to him) and we managed to travel. To put this in perspective. My co-worker has left another plane in the past and did not fly on our flight from Chicago to Mexico."
Azul Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I was travelling with a group and had paid for Premium Economy. On my flight from Manaus to San Paulo I was seated in regular economy. Others in the group were in Premium Economy even though they didn't pay for it. Another member of the group went to her seat but another passenger was in it. She was assigned a window street the stewardess told her to take his seat, which was a middle seat. Azul did nothing to resolve the problems. Throughout our booking they were non-responsive, and did not answer questions. Also the entertainment screen did not work."
Azul Airlines,Not Verified|  I was not able to pay my luggage on the web site. I was able to select the seats. I tried many times before the day of my trip. At the airport Azul charged for the luggage more that double price. I think this is a strategy to make customers to pay double. Which is very unfair for the customer. In the future I will not use this airline.
Azul Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Azul's website is the most amateur circus show I have ever seen. I did not receive a confirmation e-mail upon buying my tickets. I could not find my reservations on the website either, and had to write the company on Facebook to confirm that they existed. To be fair, the Facebook staff was responsive and efficient -- why do they not assign these people to the actual website? There appear to be multiple redundant versions of the company's platform, in multiple languages, and I was kicked between these versions seemingly at random every time I clicked on anything. Online check-in was a three-hour-long living nightmare: the website as a whole seemed to stop working outright multiple times, every step of the procedure (when they happened at all) stalled my laptop for twenty to thirty seconds, and I had to redo the whole thing five or six times, before it actually went through at around one in the morning. As I write this review, I am attempting to check-in for my return flight, which I had the misfortune of taking with Azul as well: I have been trying for over two hours and it will not work. They apparently expect all passengers to have a valid Brazilian CPF (ID number), a phone number fitting in Brazilian standards, and other such information that only exists in Brazil. I am lucky to have lived in Brazil before, else I would have been entirely lost.  I tried buying extra luggage three times through two different versions of the site, one demanded that I have a valid CPF, and the other did not process my payment. Fast-forwarding to the luggage check-in at the airport in Paris, there was only one counter for Economy class.  Business class had four, if I recall. The flight itself was fine. Nothing worth writing home about one way or another. But when you are left more tired and stressed-out by online check-in, a process supposed to last five minutes, than by the subsequent nineteen-hour flight, that is a problem. Spare yourself the ulcers and go with a company that knows how to maintain a functional website."
Azur Air Germany,"✅Trip Verified| Düsseldorf to Palma. Azur Air Germany operates a fleet of two worn out Boeing 767 (25+ years old, various previous operators in Asia, Africa, South America) and a single Boeing 737-900 of formerly black listed Lion Air from Indonesia. The 767 is configured very tight. Seating is all economy in a 2-4-2 configuration. Seat pitch is the tightest I've seen on any airline and feels extremely uncomfortable, even though it was just a 2 hrs flight. They used these configuration even for flights to the Caribbean - hard to imagine this on 10 hrs flight. Passengers are mostly party tourists visiting Mallorca for drinking. Which makes sense for Azur Air's very low budget target group for their flights. Service aboard was rather poor. Drinks and meals on purchase only. They didn't provide a menu because the plane is also operating in Ukraine. Therefore all magazines were in Cyrillic and they didn't have German ones aboard. That's why it was even unclear which meals and beverages they offer. No inflight entertainment and no Wifi. Cabin crew seemed pretty new in the job and unexperienced. There were no clear procedures on board and even while boarding, creating an overall unprofessional impression of Azur Air. You could tell how Azur Air staff ""disliked"" the clientele on board. They were also rather harsh when speaking to passengers. If you have the choice, go for any other airline."
Azur Air Germany,"✅Trip Verified|  Palma to Dusseldorfv. Azur Air Germany is a newcomer on the German market aiming for the very low-budget tourist niche. Passengers were mostly low-budget party travellers. Their sole B739 aircraft was purchased from Lion Air. Overall I got a poor impression of the airline's services and quality. The airline lacks professionality and reliability in many ways: - only paper-tickets, check-in at the airport only, no seat selection - three busses bring passengers to the plane at one time due to some special procedure are only some rows are allowed to board fist. Most have to wait on the apron, some passengers start smoking - check-in should open 3 hrs before the flight, but opens 2 hrs before the flight, long queues, waiting time > 45 mins - delay of more than 2 hrs - plane arrived on time, departure delayed for an unknown reason (even for their own cabin crew), delays were just shown on screens; no notification prior to the flight. Handling agent at the airport refuses any vouchers for refreshments and to issue a paper stating the reason for the delay (breaking European regulations) . Cabin on B739 in used shape with a very tight seat pitch, which varies from row to row. Hot meals are on purchase only and of average quality, the meals listed in the menu aren't available, they serve other meals instead. Azur Air only accepts cash payments in Euros aboard and refuses to issue receipts for these cash payments (meals, drinks and inflight shopping). Cabin crew is a mix of experienced and new flight attendants, they don't have visible standards or procedures which makes it look unprofessional in several ways - some crew members seem customer-oriented, but suffer from the low quality of the airline's organisation and equipment. Staff is quite unpersonal not introducing themselves in the announcements and using a harsh tone overall (they seem to be annoyed by their low-budget clientele). So if you have a choice, I'd highly recommend not to take Azur Air. Their reliability and professionality are way below average and can't compete with other low-budget charter carriers."
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified| I fly this route regularly but usually in Economy, as this was a busy weekend there were no economy tickets remaining so I booked Business/Club Europe. I never deal with check-in as I'm always hand luggage only, I headed straight into the airport and decided I'd try out the OneWorld lounge at Schiphol as this was included. There was a huge queue with people being turned away from the Lounge front desk, this however turned out to be for another provider's lounge, I checked with the front desk and was allowed to enter the OneWorld lounge. This lounge was nicely furnished with plenty of food and snacks available, nice, quiet restrooms within the lounge were also available. This space was a welcome change from the hustle and bustle from the rest of the terminal and I relaxed here for a while before my flight. The staff were very friendly and attentive. When boarding time came I made my way to the gate, of course passengers ignored the boarding order and all just crowded the gate, this left multiple priority boarding passengers unable to board until most of economy had seated, Schiphol's ground staff need to be more organised in this respect. On the plane, as this is only a 2+2 seating layout the seating was no different to economy, I expected this and the Embraers are quiet spacious despite being smaller planes. Our food and drinks orders were taken before take off so the dedicated ClubWorld staff could serve as soon as possible on the short flight. Food was a cold dish, but was a very tasty Asian style chicken and slaw, various other snacks were included and I had 2 glasses of champagne, because why not. Staff were very friendly and attentive despite how short this flight was. Arriving at London City was like it is in any class, quick and simple. Overall the experience was good, and for the difference in cost in Avios points I will now be doing this journey in ClubWorld rather than Economy in the future."
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified|  I found that I couldn't make my Ryanair flight back to London and, to my astonishment, found a BA flight to London City (my favourite airport) for 10.88 euros. The flight was on time and very good. My one, slight, hesitation is that I wish BA had told me that I couldn't check in online at San Sebastian. Other than that, I have no complaints. Indeed, at the airport, I asked the check-in desk if they might block the seat next to me, and they agreed. Once on board, I drank wine and ate a snack and was very content. If only flying was always like this."
BA CityFlyer,Not Verified|  Cabin crew were friendly and polite. Delayed 2hrs due to chaos at EDI on the outbound. However the onboard service was laughable. 86ml of water and a miniature packet of crisps described as light snack. Very light!! Had the audacity to announce it was complimentary! I know there are supply issues as well detailed in the media but that was a joke
BA CityFlyer,"Not Verified|  Having previously lived close to London City Airport, it was my airline of choice for european routes. Having moved to Canada, it was my first BA CityFlyer flight in about 5 years. Biz class from Berlin to LCY was a real let down. My partner and I were moved from 1C/D due to the galley configuration to 4A/B and then on the day we were split between 3A and 4A. I presume this was to accommodate a gold card flier. (who refused to change seats when I asked on board) With a flight deck and cabin crew dead heading back to city, the cabin service unfortunately took a nose dive after take off. The two pilots were served by row number and before row 4 leaving pax with a choice or sandwiches or sandwiches. After the meal and a drink / T&Cs the curtain was closed with 4 crew behind the curtain. No more drinks, and glass only collected as we started descent into LCY with basically no service for the last 30 mins or so. I'd still use BA CityFlyer for the convenience and comfort (better leg room), but dead heading crew should know better than to distract the Purser at the front, whilst the purser should remember who the customers are. (she was meant to be looking after). Such a disappointing experience"
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified|  Overall a lovely flight with BA cityflyer, as usual. I will review both the outbound and return. EDI-PMI. Check in wasn’t particularly friendly at EDI- no consideration for priority as a business class customer. Fast track security was good. BA lounge at EDI had a poor selection of food in the morning but plenty choice of drinks and staff were lovely. EDI - PMI flight on E-190 aircraft. 2-2 configuration for business and economy. In business the drinks were flowing constantly and a wrap was offered to eat. In economy a sandwich and free bar was also offered. Crew were friendly. PMI - EDI. Check in at PMI was chaos and took an hour for priority! Fast track security was quick. Lounge was drab and we only stayed for a coffee. There was food and drink available. Flight was good. I was in row 7 and only Arabic chicken dish left- it didn’t appeal and I asked for an economy sandwich- they only had vegan option available- sweet potato and cranberry. It was ok. Crew were lovely and drinks were flowing constantly to those that wanted it. Again economy was given free bar and a sandwich. It was nice to travel club Europe as a treat but to be honest on a 2.5hr flight low cost airlines are more than fine."
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified| London City to Berlin. British Airways' subsidiary BA CityFlyer really exceeded my expectations for such a short flight. London City is a great alternative to London Heathrow as flight prices are similar, and it is much more convenient and less crowded as it is in the city centre and is a smaller airport. The check-in and bag drop were all self-service but could be done easily and quickly, with staff present to assist. We boarded the aircraft very orderly, in different boarding groups. The seats on the aircraft, an Embraer E190, were wide and comfortable, with more than enough legroom for economy class, especially for an hour flight. The cabin was arranged in a 2-2 layout, so it was pretty spacious. Service provided by the crew was excellent and they provided a packet of chips and a drink. Overall the flight was very enjoyable and we arrived in Berlin on time."
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified|  Dusseldorf to London City. Very nice flight, including free Snacks and drinks. Legroom was okay and staff was friendly but seemed a little stressed due to a huge amount of hand luggage in this flight. Inflight magazines were old."
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified|  Return Edinburgh to London City BA's CityFlyer remains the most pleasant way to get to and from London from Edinburgh. The Embraer 190 has much better legroom than the 170 so look out for the type flying when booking. The blue leather seats and 2 - 2 layout make for comfort. Trip to London City on Oct 2 at 08:45 on the EMB190 was wholly smooth. Fantastic view of the three Forth bridges on departure. So much legroom and space, and I'm 6ft 1in & 19st. On time more or less, pleasant crew, and a free breakfast of bacon rolls or a platter of fruit salad and organic yoghurt. Water, and hot drinks. Just what was needed. LCY is so easy to get through in arrival and I was on the DLR to the city in 10 minutes flat. A great start to the day. Returning home on Oct 3 at the 14:40 on the smaller EMB170 was much less comfortable due to turbulence for at least 20mins thanks to the tail of a US hurricane passing over GB. The reassuring captain apologised several times and explained he was trying to get clearance to a higher level. Good to be kept informed. The crew were marvellous. Kind, cheerful, the best of BA. Drinks and snacks served despite the plane lurching about. All comp, including a good Glenlivet malt. Edinburgh arrival fine and into tram within 20 mins of touchdown. These jets aren't new and it does show a bit but it's a cut~above experience still compared to the alternatives. The tickets to LCY on the travel app I use are a little more than Gatwick but if you can miss the absolute peak flights the difference isn't much and, to me anyway, worth it for the good service and central location and efficiency of London City Airport."
BA CityFlyer,"✅Trip Verified|  Zurich to London City. Average short haul flight experience. Easy and smooth morning flight to London. Cabin was narrow but ok, although not very clean. The business class was half empty and the cabin crew was sometimes friendly, but most of the time enjoying themselves while chatting to each other. BA served hot food on this short flight: it looked not good and it was not good. Otherwise nothing special."
BA CityFlyer,"Not Verified|  London City to Paris Orly. I arrived just over one hour prior to my flight and proceeded to check-in. Whilst the queues were not long, it did take at least 20 minutes due to the multitude of bags of some passengers. Boarding was orderly and we left on time. The E170 has a lot of legroom compared to other BA cabins, though the cabin has started to look a bit dated with older seats and torn magazines. The onboard service was appreciated, though it was not exceptional. The service was somewhat lethargic, but they were attentive. After about 45 minutes, we began our descent into Orly. Overall, it was a great flight and if you live somewhat closely to LCY, I would recommend CityFlyer over the regular BA service ex-LHR."
Badr Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Khartoum to El Fashir, the capital of North Darfur in the Sudan, the 1hr 20 minute flight departed and arrived on time. Polite crew who patiently showed people to their seats. Two bread rolls (one with cheese the other with chicken), a cake, water, soft drink followed by tea and coffee was provided. This is more than BA can provide on their domestic or European routes so if Badr airlines can provide it in Sudan on a domestic flight to Darfur why can't BA? Overall a great flight and experience."
Bahamasair,"Not Verified|   I paid a lot of money for my relative to fly with you and you are asking for 100 dollars to a flight that's already been booked week ago? 975 USD from Cap to Nassau, Nassau to USA! How dare You ask for 100 dollars more? Your responsibility is to take care of your clients not to charge them 100 more because there's a lot of people."
Bahamasair,✅Trip Verified|  Long check in process. Delay flight without a reason. Not working online reservation system. Consistently lying personnel. Wrong baggage information at their website.
Bahamasair,"✅Trip Verified|  The worst airline in the world, they leave super late, they don't give explanations, your time is not important to them. Don't travel with them, super bad airline."
Bahamasair,"✅Trip Verified|  I'm totally confused, I have paid for an upgrade to sit in the front row and priority and when we boarded the plane we were told the seating was ”you can pick and choose to sit anywhere”. This was complete chaos and families were not informed in advance as we had kids onboard and we could no longer sit with one another. Bags have now been displaced, the flight crew couldn't tell you who was sitting in a certain seat in case of an emergency, not to mention our flight was over two hours delayed."
Bahamasair,"✅Trip Verified|  Absolutely ruined our vacation. Spent entire day on both ends of vacation fighting with Bahamasair staff about our fully paid, prebooked flight from Orlando to Nassau. We spent 10+ hours sitting waiting on a flight that never left Nassau to arrive in Orlando. There were little to no updates on flight status. The staff at the gate were rude and very unhelpful. We asked to rebook our return flight for a day later due to the loss of our day because of the severely delayed departure. We were told it was no problem and given 4 new seats on a return for a day later to make up for the lost day at airport. After our wonderful vacation in Nassau, we arrived to airport 2.5 hours early for our ticketed flights only to find out we were booked on a full flight and had to be on standby, with no other departing flights for that day. We were stuck and had connections that would be impacted if we didn't get to Florida that day. So, after 1.5 hours of waiting for a customer service rep to try to bump other passengers, we were told we would not be departing that day. We were forced to purchase $1400 one way tickets on another carrier just to get to our other connections. The staff at Orlando who overbooked us on a full flight should be fired. It's unacceptable to be so careless with people's time, money and vacation/holiday time. Overall we spent 2 full days in airports unplanned which took valuable time off our vacation."
Bahamasair,"Not Verified| Our flight from Nassau to Great Exuma was delayed 1 hour, then they changed the gate without letting anyone know, almost half the plane was running to the gate for final boarding. On the return from GGT to Nassau we were delayed 2 hours with no explanation and no communication. I've flown all around the world and this is the worst communication I've seen from any airline. Not run very well in my opinion. Management needs to look at improving themselves. I would look at Western Air next time we come to Bahamas."
Bahamasair,"✅Trip Verified|  They charged me 25 USD for a checked-in bag and then it arrived ripped off on the side to FLL. It was just 5pm however a guy at the baggage claim said that they closed and that he is the only person related to the company at the airport at the moment. He made a claim for me and said to send it by email that he indicated. Well, nothing was happening for a couple of months until I wrote to a contact email from their official website. Again, a long wait and many emails, and in the end, they issued a 75 USD travel voucher for a damaged nearly new suitcase that I got for over 200 USD. Plus, I live in Mexico and went to the Bahamas once, and don't see myself going there again anyhow soon, so their travel voucher is useless. I wrote them about that and haven't heard from them ever since (a few months passed). The worst customer service ever, try to avoid this airline at all cost. And well, don't trust them with anything more valuable than 25 bucks duffle bags."
Bahamasair,"Not Verified| Fort Lauderdale to Nassau. First of all, late as usual. Air conditioning did not work. The mask policy is outdated. When are you people going to get your act together. Nothing in the Bahamas works smooth if it even works at all."
Bahamasair,Not Verified|  Nassau to Miami. Awful airline. Will never use again. We took 7 flights in total on this holiday around the Bahamas and Bahamasair was easily the worst! Destroyed husbands bag that had been in excellent condition before and been fine on all our other flights around the Bahamas. Contacted Bahamasair who refused to cover cost of replacement. My family were split up at the gate when boarding. We should have all been allowed priority boarding with the baby as we were all travelling together under the same booking. Had to wait for other family so didnt board until have the plane had already been allowed on. Baggage check in refused to allow a checked bag for my baby even though my ticket said I had 10kg. Was forced to pay an extra £35. Flight time on my ticket was an hour earlier than the I was told at the airport. Would have made it very difficult to make my connecting flight. Fortunately the connecting flight was delayed. Understand delays happen but this was a complete flight time change that I had not been notified of
Bahamasair,Not Verified|  My family and I booked a flight with them for June 2020. The Bahamas was on lockdown due to COVID so the airline cancelled our flight. According to their refund policy involuntary cancelations are issued full refund. Submitted my form 7 months ago and have been waiting to hear back ever since. Have sent multiple emails and phone calls. Just tried calling again and people would answer in English and when I began talking started speaking a different language and put me on hold again. They finally disconnected me after an hour of waiting. Avoid this company! The idea of a little bit of savings isn’t worth the hassle of dealing with them.
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   It's been a full year since my flight was cancelled and was promised a full refund. I have received numerous confirmations that my claim was forwarded to the Accounting department, but still no trace of any refund. Just save yourself energy and time and avoid them at all costs. An incompetent customer service that can't do their job right."
Bamboo Airways,"Not Verified|   Embarrassing! We booked flights months ago that were canceled. I'm still chasing after Bamboo's incompetence today. Only because I went to the counter in Saigon was I refunded one reservation, not both. It's ridiculous and I can only advise anyone not to be tempted by supposedly low prices."
Bamboo Airways,"Not Verified|  Avoid Bamboo Airways at all costs! They cancelled my flight in August and owe me over £400 in refunds. Despite chasing them weekly for seven months, they've failed to reimburse me. Terrible service and total disregard for customers. Steer clear"
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Booked an international round trip ticket with direct flights between Frankfurt and Saigon with flights to Vietnam on 14 December and flights back booked for 18 January. Then we were informed in November that Bamboo Airways had cancelled our trip as a result of an internal restructuring of the company, with the promise that the money we had paid for our tickets back in April 2023 would be fully refunded. In mid-December, we received an email saying that our refund had been processed but now, 2.5 months later, we are still waiting for our money to be reimbursed. We have emailed Bamboo numerous times but have only ever received automated messages. Attempts to call the phone hotline have also been in vain. The number no longer seems to be in service. This lack of contact and lack of a reimbursement is outrageous. Please, Bamboo Airways, do the right thing: don't ignore your customers who booked with you in good faith. Get in touch and make good on your promise to reimburse our money."
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified| I booked a flight on 07.10.2023 for 15.11.2023. On 30.10.2023, they decided to cancel without offering me an alternative flight. I had to struggle till 06.11.2023 through their non responsive helpdesk and messenger to get my request for a refund acknowledged. According to their internal rules, they gave themselves generously a staggering 90 days period to refund to the original payment method. Now it is over 94 days since their acknowledgement and over 100 days since they canceled, and they gave nothing. They didn't bother to reply neither to my requests nor to my emails. Everywhere you look in tripadvisor and trustpilot, people got the same hassle and couldn't recover their money. I regret having booked with them."
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  I was sceptical after reading the reviews but I could not be happier with the flight. Staff were polite and attentive, left on time and landed 20 mins earlier. Airplane was new and very clean. I will use them again. Only issue I had is the website that shows I know errors and had to call to ask for clarifications and also to receive the confirmation email."
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Impressed.  Booked a domestic hop at last minute. Much cheaper than it’s competitors. Had my flight cancelled from LGW to HAN earlier this month, I expected the airline to be unreliable/late, how very wrong I was. Everything was faultless, check in was smooth, boarding and departure on time, crew very courteous and polite. Arrived safely and out of the airport in less than 10 min. Overall, given a chance, Bamboo would be my airline of choice while travelling around Asia."
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Da Nang to Da Lat. The checkout process was smooth. Although there was a 25 minutes delay due to the late arrival of the airplane, once we boarded everything went on well. The legroom was not that cramped. I found the crew service even better than Vietnam Airlines flight I flew to Da Nang several days before. So, I might fly this airline again on my future visit to Vietnam."
Bamboo Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  They misplaced our luggage on our flight to HCMC from Melbourne. We were without the luggage for the entire trip of 8 days and there was no earnest attempt made to locate and deliver our luggage in the next available flight. Instead they decided to keep the luggage in Melbourne to save them the transportation costs. In spite of several emails, I did not receive any communication until the last day of my return. For all the inconvenience and additional expenses incurred on the essentials, we were offered a paltry compensation of $60. It was more an insult than a compensation and hence, I did not accept the compensation. Apparently, that is their policy. As per Montreal convention, which Vietnam is part of, airlines are required to compensate customers for baggage delays with up to $1700 USD. They are misleading people stating that their company policy allows them to compensate up to a maximum of $30 only. They turned our holiday into a nightmare as we had to shop for essentials including basic clothes for three of us, which included a 3 year old toddler. We spent over $1700 in essentials and $60 does not even remotely make up for it. Imagine spending time shopping in an alien country with a toddler when we should have been enjoying our holiday. Not just money but I Iost precious time because of this airlines. Never will I fly with Bamboo Airways."
Bamboo Airways,"Not Verified|  I travelled via Bamboo Airways to Ho Chi Minh on 3rd May 2023 and returned to the UK on 23rd May 2023. The flights were fantastic, the crew were very friendly and helpful. No complaints whats so ever. Would definitely fly Bamboo Airways again."
Bangkok Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Bangkok Airways is a lovely ""boutique"" airline. They are well run, pleasant, and efficient. They go the extra mile. I'd fly again with them in a heartbeat. It's a 1 hr. flight from Sukhothai to Bangkok. Due to massive flooding, the road to the airport was closed. However, the airfield was dry and the flight stayed on time. How did we get there? They sent a 4WD pickup truck to meet us on the other side of the Yom River, at a temple, where our driver could get us. The drive through the flood waters was tricky, but we made it, as did a nearly full cabin of other passengers. We were not charged for this service (if there was a charge, the place where we stayed may have picked it up). The flight is about an hour. Still, they served a meal, and a good one at that."
Bangkok Airways,✅Trip Verified|   Best ever internal flight I have had world wide. It was an 11am flight. It left on time arrived on time. Was served a full hot meal service on a one hour flight. Can’t rate them highly enough.
Bangkok Airways,✅Trip Verified|   Superb flight. Left on time and arrived early. This typifies the reason why Bangkok Airways is world best regional airline. You got a little bag with a sandwich and water which was tasty.
Bangkok Airways,"✅Trip Verified| This company always has to have a delay. There is not one flight with Bangkok Airways that flew on time. Always check to have enough connection time cabin crews are nice. But far away from to know what service means, too many cabin announcements that gives you a headache."
Bangkok Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  This flight was ok, but my biggest remark is that the cabin was very dirty and outdated. The tray table and the toilet (pictures provided below) were very dirty. The flight attendants were very polite and friendly. The food was pretty bland and the juice wasn’t good. The dessert was ok. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes, but everything was fine. I would recommend this airline for short-haul flights."
Bangkok Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  I was very disappointed to learn that my checked In luggage was not loaded onto my 15:45 PG961 flight out of Koh Samui. After arriving in Dubai I lodged a Baggage claim with Emirates, my 2nd leg of flight. I was able to track my bag using my airbag and it sat at Koh Samui Airport for approximately 24 hours from when I checked it in (approx 1pm) to getting an email about failing security check and asking for my combination so they could inspect it for a suspected lighter (There is no lighter in the bag). I don't understand why I couldn't have been contacted while I sat at Samui airport for around 5 hours after checking my luggage in rather than me chasing them after I arrived in Dubai with no luggage. They eventually contacted me via WhatApp asking for combination and explaining why it was not loaded onto the plane. A very bad experience overall. I am advised that I will now get my checked in luggage in the next 24 hours. So two days to get a bag from Koh Samui to Dubai."
Bangkok Airways,Not Verified|   The most wonderful airline. It’s the best food i have ever had on a short haul flight. I wish they flew to Australia. Service was friendly and as someone who is 191cm tall legroom was ample.
Bangkok Airways,✅Trip Verified|  Quite amazing that Bangkok Airways manages to serve a warm meal with drinks and coffee on a 45-minutes full flight free of charge. Even though the food wasn’t very special but still edible it impressed me.
Bangkok Airways,"Not Verified| Always great and good value for money. No issues with delayed flights and a smooth journey overall. Friendly staff and onboard service, even on super short flights eg Bangkok to Trat. At Trat airport they also have complimentary snacks and drinks."
Bangkok Airways,✅Trip Verified|  Bangkok Airways was delayed over 1 hour on flight PG305. Due to the delay I missed my ferry. Bangkok Airways refuses any compensation.
Bassaka Air,"✅Trip Verified| Flew Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air. Nice short domestic flight with a very courteous 5B crew, nothing but smiles and the Best of Cambodian hospitality during this 30 minute flight. Was the cheapest option at $24 incl. baggage and an onboard refreshment and everything went smoothly througout. Would definitely recommend."
Bassaka Air,"✅Verified Review|  Phnom Penh to Siem Reap. The cabin crew on our flight were amazing. They were smiling and managed to provide every passenger with a beverage on this very short 30 minute flight. We will definitely be using Bassaka Air in the future due to the affordable prices, cleanliness, awesome flight attendants, and speedy service!"
Bassaka Air,"✅Verified Review|  Phnom Penh to Siem Reap. Once a good airline now absolutely unreliable. Flying from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap takes 30-35 minutes but today our flight was delayed for more than one hour citing mechanical problems. This is rather unsettling especially since the last time I flew they had the same problem, but with a shorter delay. The staff hid in the back room so they didn't have to face customers and the Bassaka terms offer no guarantee of compensation for long delays. This is my last trip with this airline."
Bassaka Air,"✅Verified Review|  Phnom Penh to Macau. Within 3 days we took 2 flights with Bassaka Air, Siem Reap to Phnom Penh and Phnom Penh to Macau. It is a great option to travel between the  Cambodian cities. In the first flight we had no incidents, everything went great, boarding, flight, great service. The 2nd flight was delayed for 12 hours and with no other options they abandoned me at the airport for that long. When trying to reach the company to understand what happened, after a few emails back and forward they just left me with no response, even after I reminded them weeks later. It's easy to provide a service if everything goes as planned. When something wrong happens is when you separate the best from the others. This was simply the worst possible customer care service. A"
Bassaka Air,"✅Verified Review|  No complaints about this airline on our flight from Siem Reap to Phnom Pehn in July. No queue at check-in, comfortable seats with plenty of leg room. The A320 is old but very comfortable and clean. Cabin crew and check-in staff very friendly and professional. The flight departed early and was in the air for about 30 minutes and they still managed to serve refreshments during the flight. Excellent value as well with the tickets for both of us about the same as travelling by bus. Would recommend Bassaka very highly and I hope they grow and prosper in the future!"
Bassaka Air,"✅Verified Review|  Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air and I found this airline to be brilliant in all aspects. Their prices are phenomenal and I couldn't complain about anything. Check in was super fast and done with a smile. The plane is a little outdated but its still new and growing. The flight itself was 30 mins, and for such a short flight you even got a complimentary drink."
Bassaka Air,"✅Verified Review|  Flew Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air. As I knew nothing about this airline I was a bit apprehensive, but there was no need to be. Check-in was fast and friendly. Boarding was by bus, and once on board the courteous cabin crew made us feel very welcome. The plane was definitely old, but very clean and our exit row seats had plenty of legroom. Other seats looked a bit cramped, but the flight was short. Surprisingly a quick drink was served during the 40-minute flight, which operated 10 minutes early. Overall a pleasant experience. The only negative was that the Fasten Seat Belt signs in the cabin were not working."
Bassaka Air,"I decided to fly to Siem Reap from Phnom Penh as it was a much quicker and enjoyable. I cannot believe the price of the Bassaka Air flight, it was pretty much the same as a bus. The check-in was the quickest check in I've had at an airport anywhere. The staff were great and it was the first time I've ever been on a budget airline where I received a free drink. Bearing in mind we were only flying for 30minutes. I can't speak highly enough for this airline."
Bassaka Air,"Booked 3 seats one way from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap on the Bassaka Air web site which only seem to be released 1 month in advance. FA's were very attentive in helping store luggage, reasonable English spoken. Cabin announcements were clear, seat comfort was okay. The flight is only 40 minutes with take off and landing, but they still were able to serve given either juice or water. On time flight, I would fly with Bassaka Air again, good price ticket $US 22 with taxes."
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Flight delayed by about 100 minutes, no info received from carrier via email prior to departure. I could have stayed in bed for another 1.5h! Flight status function on airline website not working, shows flight as punctual. Flight itself nothing to shout about. Due to the non existing communication from the airline, not recommended!"
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified| New aircraft, B737-8Max. Better business class seats as compared to the old 737-8. Check in at Perth was curt and unfriendly. Boarding processes was good. FA's were attentive and responsive. Food was terrible, basically economy class food on a tray. They actually have IFE that works albeit extremely limited content. Ground staff at KLIA were good and overall I cannot complain about this flight apart from the food. It was a Business promo ticket so no lounge access. It really is a budget airline cutting costs at every opportunity."
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Business class on a low-cost hybrid airline. Overnight flight. Boarding call was a mess. Seats are terrible, old and dated and the recline controls don't work properly. No IFE despite there being huge screens. Batik does not update their website and it's hard to manage your booking but easy to add on services like food etc. The app doesn't work so you can't check in and have your boarding pass on your phone. The attendants were pleasant and proactive, even offering me wine at 4am! The food was terrible, basically an economy class meal served in some china. I guess you get what you pay for. But I have to say the flight was on time and uneventful."
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Terrible, from not being able to check in online to the flights takeoff and landing. We waited 25 minutes in 30+ degree weather on the tarmac with no shade for a bus to take us to the terminal where we still had to wait another 30 minutes for our bags. If you have another alternative to fly with I would suggest you use it. Cabin crew were decent and cabin was clean."
Batik Air,"Not Verified|  In July this year, I booked family flight tickets from Canberra to Bali on Batik airlines for 13th December 2024. I just received a call (27th Sep) from Webjet informing me that the service is cancelled - Webjet knew about the change since 13th Aug, but decided to call me up today. On checking with local Australia Batik airlines contact number, I found that since last month no flights are operating between Canberra to Bali and they have no plans to resume this service in near future. I read newspaper articles stating that flights from Canberra to Bali were reduced from 3 to 2 flights per week, but have not found any information that all flights have been stopped. We booked tickets in July hoping to get a cheaper fare. I now have to book tickets again at a much higher fare, and Batik is only offering a refund, they do not give replacement flights from Canberra to Bali. We all expect airlines to be more transparent and help people in these tough times where every person is feeling the stress of cost of living pressures."
Batik Air,✅Trip Verified|   No respect for customers. My flight took off without warning 30 minutes before the announced departure time on 09/10/2024. No refunds and no help from staff.  First and last time I choose this low quality company! Aucun respect pour les clients. Mon vol a décollé sans avertissement 30 minutes avant l’heure de départ annoncée en ce 10/09/2024. Aucun remboursement et aucune aide de la part du personnel. . Première et dernière fois que je choisis cette compagnie low quality !
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified| Worst flying experience ever, the food was absolutely atrocious, drinks served were minimal - just red wine, Carlsberg beer and vodka available, no comfort pack (eyeshades and earplugs), seat recliner and foot extensions did not work (pic of seat controls attached), no inflight entertainment. The food was bland and inedible, no butter with the bun - (which supposedly had custard inside!), dessert was something brown which tasted horrible. The business class on this airline is seriously below what anyone would expect for the price charged."
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Simple 45-minute hop from Singapore to Malaysia, in a new and modern Boeing 737 MAX 8. Seats were new and upholstered in a pleasing light-coffee-brown colour with a headrest. Legroom was fairly generous for a Low-Cost Carrier and looked to be comfortable for flights of up to 4-5 hours, definitely more comfortable than what AirAsia/Scoot were providing.  Meals and beverages were for purchase, the cabin crew provided complimentary water. IFE screens were turned off. Despite the take-off time being delayed by close to half an hour, that was due to orders from ATC given that the weather was storming at that moment, and the crew made up for it as much as they could, eventually reducing the deficit to ten minutes."
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified|   Took advantage of the recently introduced direct service between CBR and DPS. Within 5 minutes of boarding I wish I hadn't. The unsmiling crew were obviously exhausted having flown overnight from DPS on the incoming flight. Mistakenly I had expected Batik would base some crew in Canberra. I had also assumed that catering would be loaded in Canberra although that was mistake number two! We were served an inedible meal of very spicy chicken and rice at 8am which had been loaded in Denpasar the night before. This was the only meal service during the 6.5 hr flight. My seat was broken with no working USB charger and the aircraft dirty. Flight attendants hid behind the curtain for most of the flight glued to their devices. Not once was there any announcement by the Captain or First Officer. A family of four received an upgrade to business class after handing over $1,000 in cash. I then witnessed them being charged $15 for a tube of pringles ..... seriously! About 5 hours into the flight I asked if there was anything to eat to be told ""no"" and the only thing to drink was water. Our tickets cost over $3,000 one way for the two of us. This was by far the worst flight I've taken in any class of travel. Next time I'll fly from Sydney and not on Batik."
Batik Air,"✅Trip Verified|   No lounge access with a business class ticket. I am absolutely gob-smacked. Apparently, they have 2 class of business class. So what am I paying for in Business Class, I asked. For your larger seat and a meal, was the reply. Am absolutely appalled with this and I would advise everyone do not buy business class in this airline. Do not waste your money."
Beijing Capital Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I take this airline from Hangzhou to Lisbon 8th May. The food is good taste and various. I have stony insomnia problem, and i did not pay attention and lost my sleeping medicine into rubbish. I told the air hostess, she is warm-heart and patiently helped me search the rubbish patiently almost taking 3-4 hours, and finally searched my sleeping medicine. I am thankful for this!"
Beijing Capital Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  Flight attendants hospitality service careful consideration. I hope the Wi-Fi on airplanes will be better in the future. Cabin clean and tidy. It was an unforgettable journey
Beijing Capital Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Overall quite satisfied with this flight. The service of the flight attendants was very good, very attentive and thoughtful, which made me feel their attentiveness and warmth. The cabin seats were a bit hard, the entertainment system was partially out of order, the movie selection was relatively small, the route was long, and there weren’t enough movies to watch. I am quite satisfied with everything else and would recommend this airline to my friends.  对本次航班整体比较满意。乘务员的服务非常好，非常细致周到，让我感受到了她们的用心，非常温暖。客舱座位有点硬，娱乐系统有部分的故障，电影的选择类型也比较少，航线时间长，电影不够看。对其他方面都比较满意，会向朋友推荐这家航空公司。"
Beijing Capital Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Lisbon to Beijing. The most terrible is the plane meal, the worst of my flights.  Although the various conditions on the plane are not satisfactory, the only thing that is worthy of being the service of the crew, who are warm and thoughtful. But if the next time there are other options, I would not take this flight"
Beijing Capital Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Beijing to Xiamen. I used  Capital Airlines flight from Beijing to Xiamen, and I felt that the flight attendants were in excellent service. Although the meals is a sandwich, the taste is quite good, that my son ate three.  I ordered coffee, my wife drank tea, which is very traditional Chinese. The plane arrived 30 minutes late, but it arrived on time, which pleased me. It is worth mentioning that, in front of my pocket, there is an tablet computer, there are many videos and movies, it is very convenient. The only problem is that carbin crew sells souvenirs during the flight, but it's understandable that airlines want to make more money. On the ground, Hainan Airlines owns the T1 terminal in Beijing, and the Capital Airlines is a subsidiary of Hainan airlines, so it is also at t1. Boarding pass, checked baggage, boarding is very convenient, the terminal is also very clean."
Beijing Capital Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  I took the overnight Beijing Capital Airlines flight from Phuket to Sanya. It was mostly empty, maybe 30 people on the entire plane. They gave me a sandwich but did not have black coffee though. Only coffee with sugar and milk mixed in. The flight was pretty painless. I had to check in at one terminal and then take a shuttle bus back to another terminal to enter the gate."
Beijing Capital Airlines,"Departed from Singapore and arrived in Beijing on 01 August 2015 at 1440hrs. To avoid missing the Beijing Capital Airlines flight as planned to depart at 2110hrs the same day, we went to the Information Counter at Beijing Capital International Airport to confirm the terminal for boarding. We were only aware and informed that the flight has been cancelled upon checking at the Information Counter. From the flight booking details, it was clearly stated one of my company’s contact number and email. However, the airline did not ensure that we were informed of the flight cancellation. After checking at the Information Counter, a phone call was made to Beijing Capital Airlines to re-confirm the cancellation of the flight and to find out why we were not being informed. No answer was given. In view of our original arrangement in Hulunbuir, we also check with the Beijing Capital Airlines on the next earliest available flight to Hailar. However, all flights to Hailar was fully booked due to peak season. And we were informed by the airline that the earliest available flight was on 05 August which affected our original plan greatly. To minimize the delay to Hulunbuir, we have no choice but to source for alternative flight from another airline, having the earliest available flight on 04 August. According to our conversation with Beijing Capital Airlines's operator, the airline was able to refund our tickets. After made a request of the Flight Delayed Certificate and ultimately we received it after we come back from our trip. Reason stated in their certificate is cancelled due to aircraft adjustment. We were required to write-in to request to claim of our refund and follow-up by some other procedures. However until to-date, we are yet to received a reply from the airline. We find no other way to make our request and was like being ignored. No follow-up action by the airline. I hope someone able to assist on the matters."
Beijing Capital Airlines,Was unable to find much about this airline in terms of reviews except that it is a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines. My family and I flew with them today from Chengdu to Lijiang China. First impressions of the A319 were good. Aircraft looked reasonably new and was clean. We had fine weather flying across the mountains to Lijiang which made the flight quite comfortable. Was on time leaving and arriving.
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Мою супругу летящую сегодня транзитом через Минск не выпустили из аэропорта даже со справкой отрицательного результата Covid, так что ей придется ночевать в аэропорту. Несмотря что это разрешается постановлением совмина РБ N 624. Так что хорошо подумайте перед покупкой авиабилетов Belavia через Минск. My wife travelling on transit Belavia flights via Minsk was just not allowed to exit the airport, even with negative Covid test, so has to sleep in the airport tonight. This is in a contraction with the resolution N 624, regulating border control during pandemic period. So think twice before booking Belavia tickets via Minsk."
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Flew with this airline a few times and each time was OK. Then in May 2020 i booked a ticket from Kazakhstan back to the UK via Minsk. They then cancelled the flight a couple of days before due to COVID. I followed instructions and applied for a refund/credit for the price I paid which was just less than 300 Dollars. I filled in the appropriate document and sent it along with the eticket, a copy of my passport etc. I have since emailed them multiple times. It is now September and I have not heard a single thing from them they have just taken my money and ignored me. Disgraceful."
Belavia,Not Verified|  Poor customer service. Covid has made life miserable for all of us. Belavia does not care about government restrictions and recommendations. Only company asking for money rebooking flights because of Covid and not caring about any government restrictions and recommendations. Extra fees are sent to be paid by email link and needs to be paid in 5 hours.
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Minsk to Gatwick. The airport in Minsk looks like it has been renovated recently and it was modern and efficient. Boarding was slightly delayed but we got to Gatwick on time. The aeroplane was fairly comfortable and you get a bit more room in an Embraer which has a 2x2 seating configuration. The food and beverages were quite good and the aeroplane had some cool branding featuring a tank-based computer game that was developed in Belarus. Cabin crew were a little gruff and could have been warmer and more welcoming, but overall it's a decent product and good value for money."
Belavia,✅Trip Verified|  I was travelling from London to Minsk via Amsterdam for a holiday in Belarus. I just about made my connection and the boarding process was efficient and ground crew friendly. The Embraer was quite roomy inside because there are only two seats to a row. The staff spoke English but not well and the level of friendliness and customer service was adequate but lower than you would find in a western airline. We arrived in Minsk a little bit ahead of schedule and I thought the airport there seemed modern and efficient. The food and drink on board were quite good. The airline is good value for money and their online booking process was very clear and easy to use.
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Tel Aviv to Minsk. Amazing flight, no delays, we boarded quickly, clean aircraft, really comfy seats and the food was great - choice between sausages and beef and we got a waffle, cherries, bread with the the meal. Staff was really nice, no complaints."
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Moscow Domodedovo to Minsk. My previous experience with this airline was quite negative, but this time, there were almost nothing critical to complain on. The procedure of online booking and check in was smooth and quick, recently Belavia introduced low-cost tariffs (without checked baggage, etc) which allowed to make prices more reasonable. Ground procedures in Domodedovo were rather slow but this is not an airline's fail. On-board experience was great - I was lucky to get modern aircraft because Belavia still operates some ancient Boeing 737 Classic but this time it was a new B738 instead. Cabin crew were awesome. There was even a meal service (ham/cheese sandwiches) despite the flight is just 1h long. What was rather disappointing - bussing to terminal instead of jet bridge both in DME and MSQ. Maybe they have a reason for this, but in both airports I saw a lot of vacant jet bridges. Also - cabin was very cramped like in low-cost carriers. Possibly they are managing to cut costs in such a way. I criticize Belavia often for 'cosmic' prices on European destinations, for old aircraft, for monopoly on flying to MSQ from several destinations (especially European), for 'Soviet-style' of management that one can face sometimes - but this particular flight was rather nice."
Belavia,✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to Minsk. I had to change ticket and they charged €50 euro for per ticket but never gave me back the price difference. It’s not only that I had sent them 4 emails but no reply from customer service. Very bad reputation.  Avoid this airline by any cost.
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Saint Petersburg to Minsk. So first hosts was good, no problem about them. But in airport Belavia employees was really rude. Same week I had 2 more flights with Delta and Air France and did not have any problem like this. I will never flight with Belavia anymore."
Belavia,"✅Trip Verified|  Minsk to Gatwick. A very pleasant flight. Boarding was quick, the aircraft was clean and the seating was 3+3. Leg room was adequate. The flight took off on time and landed on time. Meal service consisted of a standard hot meal with soft drinks and tea or coffee. No alcohol was offered. This was a short 2 1/2 hrs flight and so the meal was very good. There was no in-flight entertainment."
Berjaya Air,Singapore to Tioman - a short 50 mins flight. After check-in and security checks we were asked to go to the gate and wait for boarding. Just before boarding it was announced that flight was delayed and we would have to wait 5-6 hours. A S$5 McDonalds coupon was provided. The only saving grace was that it happened at the Changi airport which probably is the best airport in the world. On our return flight delayed again at Tioman airport this time for 6 hours and staff were completely unapologetic about it. The airline made last minute arrangements to take all passengers to Berjaya resort but the bus did not wait for us. Another bus was arranged half an hour later and bus driver asked us to hurry up. Will I recommend this airline to anyone - absolutely not.
Berjaya Air,June 2013 from Singapore to Tioman and back. Airplane was a Dash-7. Interior of the plane was in horrible condition dirty walls sticky arm rests. The arm rest of a seat was fixed with glue. Flight took about 40min. The cabin crew served a bottle of water and some nuts. I can recommend the airline if you can ignore the obvious lack of cleaning inside the plane.
Berjaya Air,Travelled last month from Subang to Penang. Flight was great! Flight attendants were friendly and welcoming. No in flight entertainment but there were magazines. Only serve Peanuts fresh baked bread a mineral water and a wet towel for each passenger. Baggage allowance was also ok as the limit was 15-20 Kg. Price was also cheap as I only paid RM 88 for a one way flight. One my return flight to Subang there were only 8 passengers and the flight still continued even thought not even 10% of the plane was full. I would recommend the Airline to people who want to travel in Malaysia.
Berjaya Air,SIN-RDN Return. A new ATR-72 with two flight attendants. For a 1.5 hr flight a packed towel plus a bottle of water was given out. Although the attendants weren't very enthusiastic the crew members in the flight deck kept us up to date with information.
Berjaya Air,SZB-RDN-SZB. Return trip from Subang Skypark secondary airport in KL to Redang Island. ATR72-500 looked in good condition could not have been very old. 50 minute flight a bottle of water and a refresher towel offered service punctual and friendly both flights on time. A small airline but felt very safe flying with them.
Berjaya Air,Singapore to Tioman Island. We found the check in staff very welcoming friendly and helpful The flight in the dash-7 was what real flying is all about. Again the crew were very friendly.
Berjaya Air,Kuala Lumpur to Pangkor Island return. This is the most pleasant way of flying for those who love airplanes!
Berjaya Air,Small airline but a good one. Despite heavy turbulence on the flight from Kuala Lumpur's old airport to Tioman Island I felt safe and that the FA's knew what to do in the event of an emergency. Can't be sure of course but it felt that way. Good information from the crew about the turbulence. Small planes but comfortable for the relatively short flight. Good service during the flight.
Berjaya Air,Subang Airport to Redang. The plane was a De Havilland Dash-7 old but in good conditions. The flight has been pleasant and crew did the best to offer us a pleasant flight - water towels and a little snack. The check in area in Subang and the all airport are very nice and clean the service has been very good. They will replace their old planes soon with new ATR-72.
Berjaya Air,De Havilland Dash 7 of 1970s to 80s vintage though obviously old with little patches of tranished white paintwork on the airframe revealing it's true age. In-flight service was better than I expected. Hostesses were friendly and courteous. Though they serve packet towels some sweets on a tray and bottled mineral water they did so with high level of politeness. The only bugbear I can highlight is the lack of a hot snack and hot tea/coffee on the flight - that wouldn't have cost too much and flight was 1hr 30 mins.
BH Air,✅Trip Verified|  Teesside to Bourgas. Was delayed 13 hours at Teesside airport due to technical problem with plane. Contacted BH Air with e-ticket and boarding pass thinking delay claim was straight forward. Not heard anything back nor have CAA to whom I sent complaint to. Obviously don't care a lot for customers and European law.
BH Air,Not Verified|  Terrible service sat on the tarmac for over a hour. The cabin crew overcharged for drinks when pointed out the magazine price continued to overcharge the rest of the plane. When arrived in Bulgaria case case had been rummaged through. Complained about dishonest staff. I didn't want compensation just a investigation into dishonest staff. I will avoid this airline at all costs. I booked with Balkan so unsure why this dishonest company used.
BH Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Belfast to Bourgas. We were checked in at Belfast international, we walked through check out and still had approximately another 20 minute wait on the steps downstairs before the shuttle busses came to get us, not very safe or the best place to be waiting a long time with 2 young children. The flight over was fine, but for some reason even though I booked certain seats over and back, they did not show up when collecting our tickets, they were very helpful and allocated us the same seats in Belfast but coming back from Bulgaria the seats we requested were given to someone else. Staff on the flights to and from Bourgas were lovely. But getting back into Belfast, after getting through the security checks, we went to get our bags and we were waiting at the baggage claim area almost an hour before bags started coming out, everyone actually clapped when they started arriving, very slowly one at at time for the first 10-15 mins, again not very convenient with tired young children starting to get impatient. I honestly don't think we'll fly with BH Air again or recommend them.."
BH Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Manchester to Burgas. Shocking airline, misleading advertising, shocking service, unhelpful staff. Flight finder sites along with their own website carry their flights as ""direct"" when they are in fact ""double touch"" which means that if you are the last destination when entering the UK you will have to get off at the first destination, go through customs and reboard the plane. You will lose your seat. Any items you have bought in duty free will get confiscated unless they are in a sealed bag with a receipt. This is ignored on the plane and the staff are uninterested in providing you with these clear bags or in sealing them. On reboarding the plane you will lose any prebooked seats, despite the gate crew telling you that you will not. The airport handling staff were unaware that they had passengers for transfer and held us on the plane for thirty minutes while they got someone down so we could queue further for them to issue us with handwritten boarding passes. Disabled passengers were unassisted. It was chaos, passengers didn't get their boarding passes as this was not communicated by the airline staff and had to get help from other airport personnel. The staff at the gate held us for an additional 30 minutes assuring us our seats would still be there when we got on but they weren't. Aircraft staff completely unhelpful and unconcerned. It might not be their fault their head office does this but they represent the company and some appreciation of the issues would not go amiss Balkan (BH Air) misrepresented their flights as direct, they weren't. If this was a one off it would be understandable but they do this as a matter of course on multiple flights week in and week out, whilst still advertising their flights as direct. Customer service is appalling and they keep your money for the prebooked seats you don't get. Do not travel with this shambles."
BH Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Norwich to Bourgas. Part of a package to Bulgaria. Chosen because of convenient flight from local airport. On time in both directions. Seat at least as comfortable as a low cost carrier, and better in a number of regards, particularly the attractive price to upgrade to the front row extra legroom seat. Onboard food and drink prices far more reasonable than people like Ryanair. Good to see the crew deal firmly with a foul-mouthed group of British tourists who were being disruptive. This plane clearly works hard over the summer and is badly in need of a deep clean over the winter, but nothing too bad. On a general note I do not think that this is the same BH air that has reports on this site re services to Sarajevo ?"
BH Air,Just flew on a one-way flight from Zurich to Sarajevo and was extremely pleased! The flight was carried out by their ATR 72 aircraft which looked pretty new and was clean too! We both departed and arrived early which I found great however What I'd noticed is that the only type of entertainment they offered on board were the magazines in the seat pockets which were rather boring but this was after all a small aircraft so I wouldn't have expected anything else. The plane was surprisingly full there were only about three unoccupied seats on board. The inflight meal consisted of a very tasty sandwich and a wide selection of drinks. Very kind cabin crew and they spoke really good English which was great! I definitely recommend flying BH Airlines!
BH Air,Flew them on the Frankfurt - Sarajevo trip on board their B737. I found the airline staff professional and friendly which can't be said about the customs at SJJ airport most of whom looked downright angry and like they hate their job. The BH airlines crew were great and boarding was quick and breeze. The flight arrived a few minutes early and I found the cabin fairly modern and clean.
BH Air,DSA to BOJ. Balkan Holidays airlines have got better and better prices onboard are expensive and prices are not in seirling. Leg room is great and the newer aeroplanes are comfortable for 3 hours. Cabin crew helpful and friendly.
BH Air,Very decent airline. Crew very friendly although their English command could be better. The cheese sandwich is fantastic!
Bhutan Airlines,✅Trip Verified|   Worse ground handling staff - no system - bad behaviour with kids including pushing them. Changed queue 4 times without any established support or system. Don’t travel if with kids and family
Bhutan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Nice aircraft and good inflight service. Good food and efficient, courteous cabin crew on both sectors. However I had a stressful checkin experience on the return flight (Kolkata to Bangkok). My checkin bag weighed 23 kg, so it was 3 kg extra, which usually is overlooked. However the checkin gentleman wanted to prove his super-efficiency and he asked me to put my hand bag also together with my checkin bag. He then went a step further and forced me to put a paper-bag with food also on the weighing scales. Then he declared that the total weight is 35 kilos, and you're allowed only 20+7 kilos, so you have to pay for the extra 8 kilos. This is ridiculous, in my 30+ years of international travel with premier and budget airlines, nowhere have the checkin bags been weighed together with all hand bags, and even food packets. I was singled out by the staff, I saw that they did not weigh the hand bags for the other passengers with me. True the bags were a bit extra in weight but if they weighed just my hand bag it would be 8 kilos, just a kilo extra, which could be excused. But this extra-zealous guy was out to fleece me. He even made me stand apart and asked me to get rid of the extra weight or pay up. It was so humiliating and stressful. Later I was forced to throw away some rice packets and then they allowed me to checkin. The funny part is that they have no system of pre-purchase baggage like all other airlines, so you're forced to pay the inflated airport rate; that is not fair policy. I had called up their helpline a few weeks before to check for purchase of excess baggage but they refused. I will never fly their airline again, inspite of the fact that the food service and cabin service was good. I have also advised all my friends to avoid this airline."
Bhutan Airlines,✅Trip Verified|   You cannot select seat through online check-in or manage booking although the option is shown on the website. The flight schedule is not dependable and keeps changing. Cleanliness is an issue and the food is basic.
Bhutan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Terrible. We are waiting two years for the refund of a Paro-Kathmandu flight purchased in 2020 (flight number: B3771). We could not travel to Bhutan in 2020 and it’s still impossible now to enter in the country (2022). First, they told us that the flight would be valid for another year. But, as in 2021 it was still not possible to travel there, we requested a refund. Since that moment, (more than a year ago), We have sent twenty emails and they do no answer. An incredible behavior of this company to its customers. We are still waiting for an answer. If it happens, we will communicate it. We have sent all the information twenty times to have our legal refund. But They have not answered yet. For the moment, We do not recommend this company to anyone. Be very careful if you buy flight tickets with them."
Bhutan Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Kolkata to Bangkok. I have nothing but good things to say about Bhutan Airlines. They're a great ambassador for their country, even though I never set foot in Bhutan. I flew from Kolkata to Bangkok on an Airbus 319 in Economy bulkhead. Surprisingly, I had the row to myself. The plane was clean and colorful, decked out in Bhutanese red and gold in the interior, and the crew were in traditional Bhutanese outfits as well. Seats were comfortable, we were on time, and the flight was only about half full. There was a meal on this short hop featuring Bhutanese cuisine and it was truly outstanding--one of the best economy class meals I've had in years. Even the inflight magazine was superb, highlighting not just places to see and things to do in Bhutan, as well as spotlighting some of the more unusual aspects of their culture, such as women taking multiple husbands. Bottom line, it was not just a great transport experience (on time, hassle free) but an educational experience about their home country as well. I can't wait to take them all the way to Bhutan."
Bhutan Airlines,"✅Verified Review|  Today, I am flying out of Paro via Kolkata to Bangkok with another connecting flight 3 hours after landing with Bhutan airlines. Their flight is delayed by at least two hours without passengers being informed properly. No signboards, no announcements. Also as they know my connecting flight I did not get pro-actively informed. Asking myself and going up to the station manager no real support is offered, no reliable forecast for landing time in Bangkok is given. I have to short term re-book my connecting flight from Bangkok to Singapore. No responsibility taken for extra cost, a hotel in Bangkok or other additional expenses. Their excuse is weather in Kalkuta not allowing their plane to come to Paro. A wonderful Bhutan experience turned bad!"
Bhutan Airlines,Flew Bangkok to Paro round-trip both flights via Calcutta. Outbound I was in Economy Plus and the legroom was excellent. The breakfast was well served hot and tasty-far more substantial that is offered on many other carriers. On the return I was upgraded to business and the leather seat was roomy and comfortable. The meal (lunch) was good but the performance of the crew was truly world-class. I have to say that I was very impressed by the professionalism and demeanour they displayed. In business one is given access to priority clearance in Bangkok which worked well but still a long wait for baggage-though mine was the first bag out. Excellent offering overall.
Bhutan Airlines,PBH-CCU CCU-PBH Y class. Check in staff at Paro very helpful friendly smiling. Cabin crew similarly accommodating and friendly. Clean cabin decent space for Y class. Light refreshments and sandwiches (veg or non-veg) served on this short 50-minute segment. Every flight has been spot on time (or slightly early). Good announcements from cockpit to point out Himalayan peaks when near Paro. Competitive prices. A good alternative in/out of Bhutan from Drukair.
Bhutan Airlines,BKK-PBH via CCU. Y class. Wet leased aircraft from Lithuania. Checked in just before closing the counter. Hassle free. On time departure. Full breakfast served on first sector and snake on short second segment. Crew efficient. Fares lower than competitor Druk Air.
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   Had a family trip to Bangkok on Biman most recent. Dirty interior, dirty food-cart, accumulated dust, glue-tape fixed overhead storage and most importantly- emergency switch at the main-entry door was broken and covered with a transparent tape. Ground handling was also as bad as before and it took at most one hour to receive our luggage. Heard that after the interim govt has taken the charge, there was a substantial improvement in the airport including ground handling. However, it's all the same old story! Authority please take a serious look on this, simply just to live on and waste public money."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| The overall experience onboard was much better than expected as it was first time flying on Biman. I had to face the most troublesome experience during the return flight from Dhaka. The 11:45 pm was first delayed to 12:30 am and then suddenly we were told it was delayed to the next day at 9:00 am. So all passengers were waiting for around 1:5 hours till they started to take us to a hotel for the night. The whole experience along the way was terrible, as even the staff were not telling us anything unless asked. After that, we were taken to a hotel which was also pretty bad and two single travellers were offered to share a room. They said they did not have single rooms and took me to the room with another random fellow traveler. But to our surprised these rooms only had 1 double bed (not separate beds). I demanded at least for separate bed. But after much argument they gave us a king sized bed and didn't even give a separate blanket at first, when asked for one, only a sheet was given. I think I will skip talking about what other things were bad with the hotel. We didn't eat dinner as there was no prior announcement and we just wanted to close our eyes ASAP. And in the morning again the breakfast was also quite terrible and dining was just so unhygienic. The hotels' name was Dhaka comfort Inn. In the morning the flight was delayed again for the third time, and fourth time till finally we got on board around 11 am. By the time I reached Tokyo it was night and could not return to Osaka and couldn't attend work the next day. Had to stay at a hotel for the night. There were no compensation. I will never fly with this airline ever again."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  Had my worst experience while travelling with Biman Bangladesh. First of all my flight got delayed for four hours. I was supposed to fly on 11.15 but they failed to provide the flight. Then provided us the flight at 3.15 and that was also late.
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  This is the national carrier of Bangladesh and by that I traveled from Sylhet to Dhaka. Though I traveled domestically, the flight was actually an international flight (London- Sylhet- Dhaka). The flights was delayed for 20 minutes. The check in process was very slow and there was long queue. We had to access the craft walking, using staircases and then boarding bridge. Only a bottle of water and a peanut stick were offered in flight. Did not get headphone to watch movie. Crew service was okay. Very high ticket flight."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| I urge you not to take this airline, even if you believe it's cheap. They never reply to you when you have a problem. The most negligent and careless airline I have ever used. When I attempted to get in touch with them via emails and phone calls after losing my luggage during a trip from Chicago to Kathmandu, they never answered and never gave me an update on the status of my belongings. Over two months have passed with no information, no updates. I also filed multiple complaints in their system no any reply."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I chose Bangladesh Biman to fly from Dhaka to Toronto and I wish I hadn't. The ticket was expensive (almost as expensive as Qatar and Emirates) but the service was extremely bad. I had to wait for hours in line just to check in, almost missing the flight. The food quality on the flight was mediocre at best, with all of the meals being bland. The cabin crew was unresponsive half of the time and despite paying $16 for 300 MB of WiFi, I wasn't able to use it for hours due to their technical difficulties. The crew never responded to my requests either."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  The worst airline, it's always delayed and their staff not responsible and they do not know how to talk their passengers. I missed my flight becauseof Biman flight getting delayed from Chittagong and once I arrive to Dhaka I go to meet them and expected some advice because first time I have face like this situation but their response is too bad. They trying to pass ball here and there."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Dhaka to Singapore. Good food, good seating and comparatively better ground services at Dhaka. Staff on board are just okay though. My travel ticket price was high though. Worst inflight entertainment service."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  I flew from Singapore to Dhaka 01 April 2023 with Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Good food, good seating and comparatively better ground services at Dhaka. Staff on board were good though the ground staffs were very rude to Bangladeshi passengers. Worst inflight entertainment service."
Biman Bangladesh Airlines,✅Trip Verified|  I was traveling from Bangkok to Dhaka. I purchased the one way ticket online (from Bangladesh) one month back prior my journey and received 10% discount. Ground service was good. Food was very poor in quality and taste. Entertainment was bad.
Binter Canarias,"✅Trip Verified|  My recent flight with Binter Canarias from Fuerteventura to Las Palmas was a delightful surprise. The flight itself was a breeze, clocking in at just 40 minutes, and departed right on schedule. Binter Canarias impressed me most with their commitment to passenger comfort despite the short flight duration. The aircraft, a brand new ATR, felt incredibly spacious with ample legroom. The cabin crew were top-notch - professional, friendly, and accommodating. They even provided a complimentary snack of water, candy, and a chocolate bar - a small gesture that went a long way! Considering the price I paid for the ticket, the overall experience felt miles ahead of what I've come to expect from many established European legacy carriers. Binter Canarias exceeded my expectations in every way. If you're looking for a comfortable and hassle-free way to island hop in the Canaries, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them!"
Binter Canarias,"✅Trip Verified|  Since March 16th trying to get refund for our April ticket to Madeira and back, via Flightfinder who, so far, has provided all the necessary info that we have asked them about, but Binter Canarias keeps refusing their responsibility and keeps sending our requests back to Flightfinder.  We liked this airline but this is just unfair policy towards its customers."
Binter Canarias,"✅Trip Verified|  Tenerife to Lanzarote. The airline cancelled the flight the days before and now I'm fighting since nearly four months to get my money back, that's 100% illegal and against the European passenger rights."
Binter Canarias,✅Trip Verified|  One of our suitcases was damaged. Zips and locks were torn off. Not sure why they had to do that because our suitcase was TSA friendly. We only found out that the zips were completely damaged after we got to our hotel. I emailed them about the situation. Sent them photos etc. Then I got a generic response that someone would get back to me. Then nothing. I emailed them several more times and no response. Very unprofessional. Don't recommend this airline.
Binter Canarias,"✅Trip Verified|  Tenerife Norte to Gran Canaria. Excellent airline, clean and new plane. They offer a chocolate snack and a glass of water, and a candy just before landing, all this in a 25 minute flight! There is even a wifi entertainment system on board! The best airline I have used."
Binter Canarias,"✅Verified Review| Lanzarote to Lisbon via Gran Canaria with Binter Canarias. Great airline. First flight with an ATR later a CRJ to Lisbon. Check-in easy and smooth. Connection LPA easy. Both flights great staff. Nice smile. Service on the first flight water and a cookie, second flight a chooice of a snackbox: sweet / tapas / mix. We had the tapas served with canarian red wine, water and later a coffee. Second glass of wine served. Great FA, nice plane as seated 2-2 and uneventfull flight. Would fly them anytime."
Binter Canarias,"Excellent flights from Gran Canaria to Tenerife North with this super regional airline. Well maintained, clean aircraft both ways. Short flights of around 30 mins, with friendly cabin crew. Newspapers brought round before take off. During the flight served glass of water with a chocolate biscuit, followed by a sweet. Just enough time to collect everything in before landing. Check in easy with no queing at both LPA and TFN. Luggage delivered on belt within 5 mins of entering baggage reclaim,at both airports. Thank you Binter Canarias for excellent service."
Binter Canarias,TFN-GMZ return on ATR72. Very good 25 minute flights. Served cup of water and chocolate bar. Great views of a snow capped Mt Teide on left going and right returning.
Binter Canarias,Flew from Lisbon to Las Palmas on 29th December. Wasn't exactly sure what to expect from such a small airline. The CRJ200 plane was fine albeit somewhat dated. Service on board was very efficient with a nice spread of snacks for a 1h45m flight. I would definitely fly with them again! A good airline.
Binter Canarias,"Flew from Gran Canaria (Las Palmas) to Tenerife North airport. Flight time was about 20 mins in a small ATR-72 aircraft. Legroom was minimal I'm 6'5"" and would not have managed much more than 20mins! Hand-luggage space is limited although your ticket entitles you to 6kg of hand-luggage and a further 20kg of checked-in luggage. The flight time is long enough for cabin crew to serve a cup of water and give you a complimentary biscuit not much but more than most airlines give these days! Flight left 20mins late this was due to air traffic control problems. If you're island-hopping it does the job!"
Blu-express,"✅Verified Review|  Milan Bergamo to Tirana. Flight delayed 3 times, waiting 3.5 hrs with no information from airline or airport staff. Even one announcement to confirm that our flight will actually happen would be better than sitting in a tiny terminal with one bathroom and a small food kiosk for hours. We're not able to leave the terminal. We're basically stranded with no plan. Horrendous experience. Will never fly with this airline."
Blu-express,"✅Verified Review|  Heraklion to Milan Bergamo. Flight almost 4hrs late, no assistance, no information. Horrendous experience and no one from Blu-express is showing up! Stuck in the airport and no clue what we'll be doing when arrived at destination since all transports will be over by that time."
Blu-express,"Milano to Havana with blu-express, part of Blue Panorama Airlines. Very old aircraft with little leg room and bad service. We asked for a place closest to the front and they put us in exactly in the last seat (we were among the first to check in) with a very bad smell of toilet since the very beginning of the flight. Other side effects : no storage for hand luggage as it is all occupied for the safety equipment. The staff were unfriendly and unpleasant."
Blu-express,Flight from Rome to Turin the plane was old but very clean the hostesses were all very friendly. It's better than other low cost airlines because they let you bring both a trolley and a small handbag in the cabin while on other low cost such as Ryanair that isn't allowed.
Blu-express,On 30 August 2012 my flight from Catania to Rome was scheduled for 9 am but delayed initially till 10.00am then two more times until 10.30 and again until 11am. Ground Staff provided no explanation and were totally unhelpful. Boarding the plane was a frustrating experience with only two buses provided to take the passengers out to the plane requiring four trips to move the passengers to the tarmac causing further delay when the flight finally opened. Once on board it took an inordinate amount of time to seat passengers due to the airline's unallocated seating policy as passengers were moved removed and moved again for o apparent reason. We eventually took off at 11.25 arriving in Rome too late to catch connecting flights to England. All in all a very negative frustrating and unsatisfactory experience and one which will ensure I never fly Blu express ever again. Whatever value for money offered by low cost fares is more than offset in inconvenience and not getting to your destination on time.
Blu-express,"I flew them twice in May between Rome and Catania Sicily. Flights were ""nearly"" on time and the cost was reasonable. Seats are standard for this class of aircraft (737) and acceptable for these short flights. I don't appreciate the ""cattle car"" boarding with no seats assigned. It makes for a longer and more difficult boarding than usual. I had a big problem on my last return flight CAT to ROM. This flight was the first of the 3 that would take me to SFO. The Blu-Express agent refused to check my bags through to my other flights. I had to claim bags in ROM and recheck them. Because Blu-Express was late arriving ROM I missed my flights to SFO."
Blu-express,My Dad and I had a flight booked from Rome to Istanbul. It was supposed to be a 10.30am flight however at check-in the girl said there was a schedule change and was now a 3.30pm flight. This made our connection tight but still ok. In the afternoon at check-in we were told the flight was delayed a further 1.5 hrs. We had a 7.5 hr delay with no apologies. This also guaranteed we would miss our flights back to Australia. We booked another flight at our own expense to get us to Istanbul on time and Blu Air couldn't get our baggage off their flight in time. 2 hrs and no sign of the luggage so in the end we checked in to our other flight and fly home without our bags. Blu Air Express offered no help it was Turkish Airlines who explained we could claim the luggage back in Sydney.
Blu-express,Last minute round from Nice to Rome. My departure flight was delayed 2.5 hrs with no information or an estimated departure time. On my return from Rome again we were over 2 hrs delayed with no information whatsoever standing in line at the empty boarding gate. Since the airline never updated we had no idea whether we could leave the gate to get refreshments. To add insult to injury the only company representative kept telling lies we were told several times that the plane was on the ground but since as the airport was busy there was no bus to pick us up. The price was only marginally lower than easyjet. I only took that flight because I could get to Rome earlier (supposedly).
Blu-express,Nice to Rome was only $89 CAD total compared to other airlines charging close to $400 per person for the same route. We did expect to be a baggage fee as they charge you $7 Euros per kg over 15kg but pleasantly surprised to only be charged an additional $49 Euros total. Plane clean staff were very nice. The reason everyone lines up 1 hour before the flight (we didn't figure this out until too late) is because seating is not assigned. That being said our seats were fine and flight was great. Only complaint was that the flight was 3 hours late in arriving. In their defence they had emailed our home email address a day or so before to notify us but we didn't have access to our home email so didn't find out until we arrived at the airport.
Blu-express,MXP-SAW on an extremely old and very badly kept 737-400. Seats in terrible condition. Toilet too. Cabin crew were very friendly and accommodating.
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Airline cancelled my flight from Tel Aviv with zero notice despite having a mobile telephone number and my email address. I turned up at the airport to discover the flight had been cancelled. Desperately trying to get out of Tel Aviv I discovered this company doesn’t even have a telephone number to contact someone! They also do not respond to emails that you can only send via their website (yes, no email address either). I have now sent three emails via their website asking for a full refund to which I have received absolutely no response whatsoever. This airline has zero customer service skills, effectively left me to organise alternative flights home. It’s now been 3 weeks and yet still nothing from them."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Terrible airline, they cancelled my flight 2 or so weeks before it was even supposed to take off due to not enough people booking tickets. They did offer me a different flight however this was days before I was even in the departing country. They then agreed to a refund at which point they have kept dragging out with whatever excuse suits them on the given day as to why it can't be refunded yet and then stopped replying altogether and have not honoured the refund. Paid for a flight that never existed in the first place."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified|  We had a terrible experience with this company. Traveling with 2 small kids we were assigned different seats, and also had to pay 40 euros check in tax, beacuse it was impossible to make the check in online. I understand that check in should happen at the airport when traveling with small kids, but why the extra tax? The staff at the check in counter and also inside the plane are very unprofessional. I would not recommend traveling with this air company unless no other alternative."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Completely unprofessional.  They refuse to give the money back and offer no choice but accepting their lousy vouchers only to keep cancelling the flights. Briefly, they receive money from the customers and ""transform"" it into virtual money that you never get the chance to use because they keep cancelling.  Avoid it by all means."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified|  You will reach your destination faster by walking. They charge for tickets, one week later cancel flights, then you wait months to get your money back, if you will ever receive your money back."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified| I flew two weeks ago from Stuttgart airport to Bucharest Otopeni. All good, I made my check in there and my luggage was good I didn't pay anything extra. Then I flew back from Bucharest and was charged with 30€ for my check in and 35€ for the same luggage. The staff being misinformed they could not explain to me the reason. But the best part is just coming, 120 seats and 120 passengers so the plane was full, but there was more 6 people who had tickets for the same flight but no seats. Two of those six people stayed on in Bucharest. They practically sold more tickets (126) than seats (120). Good Luck with that guys I Look that everybody knows that they should not fly anymore with this company."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified|  First off it's not that cheap really, our flight departure and return destination was changed to a different, inconvenient airport at a different inconvenient time. EU regulations imply that a refund or a free change should be offered, but that won't appear anywhere in the email they send you (which essentially reads ""it is what it is, suck it up""). Thirdly, and the true cherry on top, some of the reserved seats we bought in order to travel together had to be bought again, as the child in our party was moved far from her parents for no good reason at all once the departure airport was changed. There is no customer support. Two requests to at least reimburse the same seats we had to needlessly buy for a second time and not cheaply, were systematically ignored. Ludicrous, they shouldn't be allowed to operate. Basically TAROM flies to all BlueAir destinations and these days their fares are comparable - and when you add up all the inconveniences, not only will you be happier with TAROM but also quite likely with more cash in your wallet. Avoid like the plague."
Blue Air,"Not Verified|  Although I paid for check-in online, the data was not transmitted to the flight operator until this time. We were also charged 350 lei for check-in by Blue Air. Also, their operator at Cluj Napoca Airport said about the eSky company that you are that collects money from customers for services you do not do. Unprofessional conduct. Charges extra money for tickets bought from other operator. I used eSky many times before with no problem till blueair."
Blue Air,"✅Trip Verified| My flight with Blue Air got cancelled twice in 2 weeks. I got a cancellation notification, I had to change my travel plans, lost a lot of money on accommodation, to find out 1 weeks later that my modified flight is cancelled again. They sell tickets, cancelled the flights and operate with our money as it's also impossible to get a refund or reach out to customer support. Extremely unreliable, I can't believe something like this even exists. This really has to stop."
Blue Air,"Not Verified| Dublin to Bucharest. Website a waste of time - full of lies; type words like name, address and other information with problems, double up the letters; constantly showing is loading - I've tried from different devices, different hours, the same problem -  similar with the app! The call centre just doesn't exist! (another website lie) - 5 stars for advertising fake promos! A shame!"
Blue Islands,Not Verified|  Comfortable enough flight which was fairly on time. We were surprised that there was no catering on this flight of about 2 hours. Only took hand baggage.
Blue Islands,"✅Trip Verified|  I was on the 09:00 SI 2258 flight to BHX from Jersey on 01/12/21. There was a technical fault and we had to turn around. This flight was then cancelled and I collected my luggage with no instruction as to what to do next. So I called Blue Islands and spoke to a representative who said the best she could do was put me on another flight SI 5554 to East Midlands due to leave at 14:10, but this was further delayed until 15:25. I landed at East Midlands at approximately 16:40. I then had to get a taxi to Birmingham airport costing me £89.22 meaning I did not get back to my car until around 19:00. I was given the impression by the representative that I would be eligible for some compensation to cover my extra expenses and time and that I should keep my receipts. That did not turn out to be the case. As Blue Islands operate outside of EU regulations I was not eligible for any compensation as per their terms and conditions. I double checked this a they were technically correct so I asked if it would be possible to have my taxi fee refunded at least as none of this was my fault. This was refused and simply said I should take it up with my travel insurance. It is neither their or my fault that I am out of pocket. I've never known such poor customer service from a company. At least 6 of us fly to Jersey every year and we will certainly not be using Blue Islands again."
Blue Islands,"✅Trip Verified|  Jersey to Southampton. I bought duty free onboard using my debit card. They wrote down my card details and asked me to sign as they did not have a card machine. On checking my account, i had been charged twice. I know these things happen so i emailed, bearing in mind this was the 22nd december, and i did not receive a reply for 3 weeks. In this email i enclosed a picture of the receipt and a picture of my bank statement showing that it had been charged twice and the email described how this often happened when pending and that it should sort itself out, which was utter rubbish as it wasn't even pending at this point! Emailed twice more and nothing since. Advice for anyone else is to not use your cards onboard!"
Blue Islands,"❎Unverified|  An utter disgrace. Flight departed Jersey late as heavy fog over Southampton was making landing impossible. A break in the weather meant that the pilots decided to give it a try. As it transpired, by the time we reached Southampton, the fog had resettled and we weren't going to be able to land. The flight returned to Jersey. En route back to our point of origin, the cabin crew told passengers that we'd be 'looked after' by Blue Islands on our return to Jersey and that taxis and overnight accommodation would be provided by the airline. However, when we returned to Jersey Airport, there was not a single Blue Islands employee to be found. The Swissport employee who rebooked the passengers said that provision of taxis and hotels was (understandably) not a Swissport obligation, and this meant that Blue Islands had not only failed to provide the taxis and accommodation promised, but didn't even have the courtesy to send an employee to inform us of the same. We were abandoned at the airport and left to fend for ourselves.  When I made a complaint, various Blue Islands' staff denied that we had been abandoned at the airport because Swissport had rebooked us and that Swissport were 'representing' Blue Islands. Being rebooked and then left in the airport without the taxis and accommodation promised, and then being left to fend for ourselves doesn't equal abandonment in the world of Blue Islands. I did wonder what I would have done if I didn't have the money for a hotel or the means to get there. I couldn't tell if anyone from Blue Islands could have cared less as they didn't even have the courage to find an employee to 'front up' to a very angry group of 20 passengers who had been lied to then abandoned. You can't actually rate this level of 'customer service' because there wasn't any. That Blue Islands couldn't land in Southampton due to fog is not their fault. To return the passengers to Jersey and then just leave us in the airport is absolutely unforgivable though. I can honestly say that in c.40 years of flying worldwide I've never experienced anything like this. As you can probably guess, some two months after the event I remain disgusted with the way the passengers on this flight were treated. Blue Islands told me that the cabin crew shouldn't have promised taxis and accommodation. Maybe so, but it didn't stop them from doing so - repeatedly - and when you make that commitment, you are obliged to follow it through if you want to be taken seriously as a company that has any interest in the concept of customer service. Blue Islands didn't follow through, they just ran away. This behaviour was shameless and exacerbated by Blue Islands showing absolutely no contrition whatsoever and claiming that being rebooked by Swissport somehow did not equal abandonment by BI - not only a nonsensical argument, but an offensive one. An absolute joke of an 'airline'. If they had any competition on the routes they fly then they'd be out of business in a fortnight if their behaviour on the night in question was the norm. Shocking. Offensive, uncaring and ignorant. Avoid."
Blue Islands,"❎Unverified|  I hate to say this, but my opinion of Blue Islands has really changed after my flight to Southampton. It started by the airport announcing that my 7am flight was delayed to 9.40am due to a late inbound aircraft. Once 9.40 came around, we were informed that the flight was delayed until 10.50am, due to 'bad weather' (there was light mist but lots of other aircraft were arriving in fine). Soon after that, we were informed that Blue Islands had no idea when our plane was going to arrive, and told to wait until 10.30 for new information. The 'new information' was infact just that the new information would be coming at 11.30am. And then 'next info at 12.30', and then 'next info at 13.00'. Absolutely no Blue Islands or Flybe staff around in the terminal. Then, our plane lands, but the delay still keeps on being pushed back. In total, we left about seven hours late. On the way back we were delayed about half an hour, which isn't too bad. The aircraft we were on were clearly very old and tired. There were some loose pieces of metal on the cabin walls, and the seats had small damage, and overall the cabin was fairly discoloured and dirty. Cabin Crew were very friendly however. I usually am fine with Blue Islands and have no problems with the Flybe franchise, however the service was awful. I would try and avoid Blue Islands in the future."
Blue Islands,"❎Unverified|  Guernsey to Southampton. Such a huge disappointment that what used to be a great little Channel Island based airline has now merged with FlyBe. A route that was already relatively expensive, for the air miles travelled, has now become excessive due to the unreasonable way that FlyBe charge for absolutely every aspect of your booking, including booking seats (how else do they propose we travel in an aeroplane?) and taking luggage. This has greatly increased the ticket prices (on a recent review of tickets for later in 2017, I found this to have worked out at approximately £100 increase, roughly a third increase!), which I think is disgraceful. What used to be a small, customer focused company appears to have sold its soul to the devil and been swallowed up by the greedy big boys and I will have to think twice about who we fly with in future: such a shame as I always chose Blue Islands previously, for so many positive reasons."
Blue Islands,"✅Verified Review|  Southampton to Guernsey. Really disappointing now that they are incorporated to Flybe. Previously flew this route often with Blue Islands, always good service and on time. Now, impossible to book with free baggage, prices increased, less staff at Southampton and bundled in with other rest of Flybe flights so long check in queues. I understand that airlines need to adapt and move with the times, but why Blue Islands have had to drop to Flybe standards I don't know. Onboard service ok, but expensive/ poor selection food and drink. Would rather have the old lounges and tiny planes back! Would recommend flying Aurigny from London or Bristol instead!"
Blue Islands,"✅Verified Review|  I booked flights for my boss and 2 colleagues with Blue Islands to fly to Jersey on Tuesday 23/5/16 on a flight due to depart at 14.40. I booked the flights online on 27/4/16 and checked them in online on 22/5/16. When they arrived at London City on Tuesday they were told by airport staff that Blue Islands have changed to their summer schedule and that the 14.40 flight does not operate any longer. Not only was I able to book the flights less than a month ago, I was also able to check them in online and print boarding passes for a flight that was not operating. We received no message whatsoever that the schedule had changed and in fact they are still selling this flight on their website. I've had no response to date to any of my emails or voicemail messages left with their 'Customer Care' department. My colleagues also informed me that there is no Blue Islands desk in London City Airport."
Blue Islands,"Absolutely appalling. Blue Islands changed my booking less than 24 hours before the flight from Bristol to Jersey by 3 hours on the way out 4 hours on my return journey. They didn't have the courtesy to call me to ensure that I received this important message, and did not apologise in their email and neither have they apologised subsequently, despite writing a complaint. The actual flight was very loud, but apart from that is adequate. But with such high prices you would expect much better customer service and it appears as this is completely lacking."
Blue Islands,"Saturday afternoon phone call to say Monday's Blue Islands flight (23rd May) from London City to Jersey was cancelled. No emails, no messages, lucky I picked up the phone call. Very unhelpful offers of other flights far too early or far too late. Shambolic, trip ruined, what a rubbish airline."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Milan to Tirana. Scammed and held at ransom for new tickets.  I cannot believe we have been cheated out of new tickets at the checking in desk. No middle name no boarding. We fly very often and can't remember last time middle name was required. I fully believe this is unfair to make more revenue from already paying customers. The airline was fined in 2019 by the Italian Competition Authority for this ery issue. It is impossible to get through to the complaint department (if there is one). You have to write a letter and send to Italy. Cannot call or email. Avoid if you can, or at least don't forget middle name. Wizz Air, BA better choice."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Milan to Tirana. Same story as most other people on this page, 27th August we turned up at Milan Malpensa airport to fly to Tirana where we had arranged to meet up with out our elder daughter flying in from Budapest - so we could not back out of flying. At the check-in the airline agent told us me and my wife had not included our middle names - mercifully our younger daughter hasn't got a middle name - and that we had to re-purchase tickets from scratch at last minute price. In short, we had to pay an extra €638 on top of the €324.86 we had already paid through Opodo. Steer well clear of this airline, the sooner it goes under, the better!"
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Milan Bergamo to Tirana. I was denied boarding and forced to buy new tickets on Blue Panorama flights, as my second name and third names were not on my ticket. This obligation wasn't clear, the airline's rules are ambiguous and Expedia.it for example, doesn't require the second name for a Blue Panorama ticket. The airline doesn't offer online check-in and changes can't be made less than 24 hours in advance. Blue Panorama's rules are profoundly different to that of other airlines and evidently do not conform to the most basic international standards. So far, the airline has refused compensation."
Blue Panorama Airlines,Not Verified|  Rome to Santorini. After lining up for over an hour to check our bags in we were told that we needed to go change my partners name on the booking as his middle name was not on it. So we had to pay an extra 50 euro to get this done even though it was not an option when we were booking the flight online. When we were at the service counter we were chatting to a family and another couple who said that had to do the same thing. This is an absolute scam and would 100% not recommend flying through this airline.
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Mykonos to Milan Bergamo. Middle name change is a total scam. Some had to pay €300 depending on the time they have booked it, some people chose not to pay and didn’t fly, the airline is super shady and is scamming thousands of people daily."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  We recently flew from Santorini to Rome on Blue Panorama airlines. Upon arriving at checkin we were forced to pay an additional E300 to Blue Panorama due to the fact that my wife’s middle name was not shown on the actual booking. For clarity her name appeared as it does on her passport, the booking was in their system but it merely did not have her middle name shown on the booking. I explained that her legal identity was the same as the booking and showed multiple forms of identification to no avail. I am not sure how this could be the case but we were nevertheless forced to pay this extra amount of E300. We witnessed other passengers being stung in a similar fashion and one family of four was forced to pay E1200. When I objected I was told “no pay no fly”. This is outrageous and amounts to no more than theft and is in my opinion a complete scam being operated by this airline."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  
I was incredibly surprised when I was denied boarding on my flight last week from Rome to Zante because I did not include my middle name on the booking. Upon finding this out, Blue Panorama's office to update the ticket with middle name claimed 'that their machines were down' (I must say, it was not a good look for their airline and their online reviews have suffered because of it - this would probably explain why their plane was at 40% capacity. I only checked the reviews after this disgusting experience). They claimed I needed to buy a new ticket. To charge the full price for a replacement ticket when my middle name was not even added to the new ticket is quite frankly appalling. The airline also made me buy me new ticket in cash! It is a complete scam and I honestly will throw a party when this airline goes under. I strongly recommend that you do not fly this airline."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Santorini to Rome. Worst experience I’ve had, what a money grab, was early to the airport after checking in online and my flight was delayed and then I finally was ready to board and they made me go back through security just to change my name because you have to pay to put your middle name on your ticket so I almost missed my flight and had to pay 50 euros to “change my name”. Absolutely ridiculous will never fly with blue panorama again. This is a money grab."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"Not Verified|  Santorini to Bergamo. The worst airline experience I've ever. With tickets booked from our travel company they were not accepted and sent us to another desk in another part of the airport to pay 600 Euros to put middle names onto my girlfriend and get our boarding passes - total scam. In the end, after paying the 600eur for the ""name changes"" I got the boarding passes with first and last name as I had previously! Nobody could explain why we paid that value, nobody even cared if we miss or not the flight, the counter girl was almost making fun of us. Never ever again I will fly with this company."
Blue Panorama Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|  Tirana to Milan. I will never use this airline again after being caught by the middle name change scam. You may have got 60 euros from us but you have lost our business forever. The flight was Tirana to Milan, had no choice but to pay as had a connecting flight in Milan."
Blue1,"On this not exactly Blue1 cheap flight (where you don't expect much) the service was terrible. We had two very small children with us and we didn't get anything for them (no greeting, no good seats, no extra-treatment) like we got at other airlines of the same price range and although it was a lunchtime flight (12-15pm) there was nothing to eat offered - only tea, coffee and water. Not even juice for the kids! And once the service started the stewardess skipped our row (the one with the 2 babies!) and continued the service further down and the other stewardess parked her cart right in front of our row for about 5-10 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) serving other guests, collecting something here and there while my kids were crying because they saw the water in front of their eyes and were thirsty. After waiting forever I asked the stewardess behind me whether I could please get some water, she told me to talk to her colleague. When I finally catch her attention, was so grumpy that I had complained that she looked like she wanted to pour the drinks on my lap. The worst service I have experienced."
Blue1,HEL-OSL. Check-in was rude and dismissive but otherwise the flight had very nice crew and the plane was spotless clean as well. BOB meal is cheaper on Blue1 than on SAS due to the currency and I found the quality to be rather reasonable as well. On-time departure and arrival in Oslo. Ticket price was great as usual.
Blue1,HEL-BLQ-HEL. Check-in in Helsinki was awful. We already had the boarding passes printed but before proceeding to baggage drop we had to queue at the self service check-in kiosk for the baggage tags. So why do they have check-in online in first place? The queue for the baggage drop starts right next to the check-in kiosks the departure hall is very small and people were standing between the two queues. As a result many people ended up queuing in the wrong line and no-one from Blue1 did even notice what was going on. So a ten minutes operation lasted almost half an hour. On the other hand the plane was a new and shiny B717. Light coloured leather seats plenty of legroom compared to other regional airlines and friendly FA made the flight pleasant despite the clumsy start.
Blue1,HEL-ARN a very full flight operated by Golden Air for Blue1 (frequent airplane substitution). Economy Extra is at the back at the plane upon boarding. Seat comfort and space is poor even for Economy. I enjoyed the cheerful service and the nice fresh meal. Flight departed and arrived with a slight delay. This is nevertheless about the level of a competitor's regular Economy Class fare but priced a bit higher; the level of space especially is totally unacceptable for anything above LCC Economy.
Blue1,BLQ-HEL which they fly 2 weekly during the summer. A bit of a random route but the flight was full due to very cheap fares. I got in on an OW for $107 incl. all taxes. Flight departed about 35 minutes late and a little time was made up en route. Plane was spotless-clean with Blue1's new seats. Service was generally OK but everything is now for-purchase including soft drinks! Not sure how they can call themselves a full-service airline like that. Bologna is a disaster of an airport with the construction and there was only one agent for check-in for the entire flight and nothing for *G. Well for the price this can slide.
Blue1,Flew Stockholm to Helsinki. Booked a business class flight through Eurobonus miles to find that there is in fact no business class and was in fact in premium economy. The difference between this and economy on the 40 minute hop comprises a glass of wine or a beer. All pretty disappointing. The plane was on time I guess.
Blue1,ARN-HEL on the standard B717. Clean and airy cabin legroom fine for such a short hop. Coffee/tea served for free. Courteous FA's gave out a stuffed toy for the baby in our party and took extra care explaining how the infant's seatbelt worked. Bags were on the belt in minutes at HEL.
Blue1,"HEL-MUC on tired MD 87. Took the Internet upgrade opportunity for 4900€ to ""Premium Economy"". Worth it on ground service (Quick check-in Fast Track at Security) as Economy Pax had a long queue for both. The SAS Lounge in Helsinki very basic. Cabin crew friendly nice breakfast. However no English newspapers available and no comments at all to the flight from the cockpit! The price for the upgrade is ok as I had 2 rows for me alone - in contrary to the Economy cabin which was 95% full. Otherwise you are flying Low Cost with a high economy fare."
Blue1,Short trip Arlanda to Helsinki. Very nice people working on board. Cold but nice meal nice experience.
Blue1,HEL-CPH-HEL. HEL-CPH on Avro RJ85 on-time both ways. Clean aircraft crew and service are nothing special but seats comfortable and spacious in the 3x2 configuration. CPH-HEL on B71 food for purchase in both directions drinks free. In general this is competitive to SAS on the same sector but definitely a low-cost feel without a particularly low-cost price.
Bluebird Airways,"Not Verified|   I flew with Bluebird airways last week. There was an one hour delay, which is typical for low class airlines. The flight is old and they offer no meals whatsoever. I cannot say it's a bad airline . They hardly answer emails."
Bluebird Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Bluebird Airways is the worst airline ever! They weigh every single piece of luggage and item you carry on or check in, making the entire process incredibly frustrating. They cancel flights without notifying their passengers properly, leaving you stranded and confused. Their system and website are a complete disaster – canceled flights still show as confirmed and on time. When you finally reach the airport, you discover the flight is canceled. They claim to send messages to your phone number, but not even an email is sent. Do they think they're my boyfriend, sending texts to my phone? This airline is a complete joke. Avoid at all costs!"
Bluebird Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Awful. The crew is rude and have a tendency not to be of use nor help, barely English speakers the stewardess said ""no sir, in our planes the seats don't recline"" with a smugness on her face that was just disrespectful. But worry not, for the aircraft itself is a disgrace. Photos attached. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and it was a mistake I will not make twice. Sincerely rather stay at home."
Bluebird Airways,"Not Verified|  3 hours delay. Worst boarding, worst service. Very bad airplane with horrible seats. No online check in. No notification about delay. No compensation. Very bad onboard service. Worst flight of my life"
Bluebird Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Flight was cancelled, which is ok if you got a refund. Month and a half have passed and I still see no money coming. What is the most unpleasant - I can not find any phone number of support to discuss the issue. I filled in form on their internet site but have not got any reply. Very unpleasant behaviour for a business entity."
Bluebird Airways,✅Trip Verified| Definitely the worst airline experience I have ever had. It’s my first and definitely the last flight I will have with them. Changed flight time after booking putting us two hours later and the cabin baggage regulations are different than the European standards.
Bluebird Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  My family and I traveled from Athens to Prague and back and it was a very pleasant experience. It's what you'd expect from a low cost airline and the people at the check in desks (both from Athens and Prague airport) offered to check in our cabin bags at no cost so we don't carry them around. The crew was nice and the planes were in good condition. No cancellations, no delays and no hidden fees (for us at least, idk if we were lucky)."
Bluebird Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Lucky if you fly with them, have a lot of cancellations of flights and a lot of delays. Plane was clean but old and you could see her age. Crew was nice and helpful; there were announcements of the path of the flight. In flight service was minimal."
Bluebird Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  They don't have online check in. This means that you need to be at the company's ticket control 3 hours before your flight. As I did. I had to wait an hour and a half until my turn came, because two people were trying to serve two flights (all passengers need to go through the control). When I checked in my hand luggage, they asked me if I had paid for it, when I answered in the negative, they informed me that the charge, regardless of kilos, is €70 - the truth is that it was 9.8 kilos (2.8 kilos over the allowed limit). Despite my dissatisfaction, with the 1.5 hour wait to be served and for the extra charge of €70, while I paid the price, they did not allow me to take the suitcase with me in the cabin, which means extra inconvenience while waiting to receive it from my destination airport. By far the worst service from an airline. Since I didn't know her as a company, I booked a flight with her. The lesson of all history is to buy a ticket only from companies you know, regardless of price."
Bluebird Airways,✅Trip Verified|  These guys are my heroes! My flight out of Tel Aviv kept getting cancelled due to security issues. I was stranded in Israel. But this little airline kept flying people out. They flew us out when it was war. God bless this airline for its courage and service to us stranded Americans.
bmi Regional,"✅Trip Verified| The flight was ok - Cabin staff nice and helpful, but there are some problems: - my baggage was delayed and I am not happy about the communication round it, I sent e-mails asking about my luggage but never got a reply (this may be handled by a subcontractor but they should make sure the subcontractor does a good job) - some stuff was stolen from my luggage, I complained about this and never got a reply. I read that they have 60 days reply policy - this is just bad, 60 days to reply to customers is a shame - on by flight back (from Bristol to Frankfurt) we had more than 1 hour delay, the boarding started this late already in Bristol (it was very chaotic) - no real reasons were given to us, when we finally boarded the plane it was covered in frost and freezing inside - I have never seen this before - the plane was always prepared and heated up so passengers did not have to wear coats also inside."
bmi Regional,"✅Trip Verified|  Brussels to Bristol. My boyfriend and I arrived at the day of the flight to the airport when they told us, at the security gate, that our flight got cancelled. We had to wait 8 hours at Brussels airport and then, we flew to Birmingham. Our original flight was to Bristol. From Birmingham, we had to pay from our own pockets a train to Bristol that was not cheap at all. Until today, 7 months after, the only thing that we heard from BMI is that they will eventually pay (this was said in August) and to be patient. We are still waiting for cost-coverage and compensation."
bmi Regional,"✅Trip Verified|  East Midlands to Brussels. Flight to and from Brussels without any issues. Check in relatively quick and no queues at airport on way there. Onboard, seating was fine with a 1-2 cabin layout. Free refreshments and a small snack. Essentially ok for a short flight. Aircraft themselves are on the older side showing some wear and tear but being able to fly from local airport is a huge bonus. Only downside is being if you need to drop a bag off this only opens 90 minutes before departure, and in Brussels on the return the queue through security was massive (longest I have queued in years). This meant once through was almost straight to the gate for boarding."

Hamburg to Bristol. Pretty much guaranteed delay again from BMI my route to work in Germany gets hit by BMI delays on outbound and return flights. I have persuaded the crewing office to let me catch a train from Plymouth to London Paddington then Heathrow express to airport to avoid using BMI from Exeter or Bristol I will get there quicker by driving (train) an extra hour and a half - go figure."
bmi Regional,"Not Verified| Bristol to Paris. What a totally charmless and unreliable airline this is. I can’t even remember a Bmi regional flight from Bristol that was on time, which clearly makes them unsuitable for business purposes. We’re now 1 hour 25 minutes late and just been served a litany of excuses that fail to engender any sense of confidence in the airline, such as ‘numerous technical problems, some still ongoing’. So it’s anything but BMI henceforth. I could have taken easyJet to Paris which departed on time, 1 hour and 15 minutes ago. And I wouldn’t have needed to check my carry on luggage in the hold. Goodbye BMI!"
bmi Regional,"✅Trip Verified|  it is the only connection that safes me from driving to Berlin Tegel to fly to Munich, I wanted to use British Midlands from Rostock to Munich. However the first booking I had was outbound 27.7. from Rostock. The takeoff was 2 Hours delayed, the arrival in Munich too. I lost my reservation at the car hire and had to pay double. At the inbound flight on 30.7. we drove to the airplane by bus, where waiting there 20 Minutes in front of the airplane, until bbeing told there is no crew here yet. The actual departure was 3 Hours delayed. Today the filght was cancelled completely with the notice 2 hours before take off. The worst airline I ever used. It feels as if they are one step away from closing down. Unfortunately I have two bookings pending from November. I think I will cancel them on my costs and accept the drive to Berlin Tegel."
bmi Regional,"✅Trip Verified|  The flight Paris to Bristol in April was cancelled because the captain didn't like the look of something on the plane. Instead of an early flight we eventually got to Bristol after midnight, not much use for the work planned that day. Their way of fooling you is simple: agree quickly that you deserve the 250 euros compensation, but then do nothing. When you complain they say the payment was made, that it then came back to them, or whatever. It's now September and I realise they never had any intention of making the payment."
bmi Regional,"✅Trip Verified| Flight cancelled on 6th May with no reason given, this was after I had checked my bag in and was sitting at the departure gate. Ground crew at Stanstead (not BMI) was extremely helpful and gave out contact details for compensation and reimbursement. This was applied for on the 8th May 2018. After numerous emails and phone calls and last communication on the 16th August to say my compensation has been process and they were still waiting to process my out of pocked expenses of over £170.00 - this is now the 14th September and I still have not received a penny. I am totally disgusted with their customer services and I will never use their service route again. Why should I be waiting this long on money which is due to me."
bmi Regional,"Not Verified| Hamburg to Bristol. Always late which they blame on air traffic control. No info at gate stating delay, have to rely on flight stats. Always park miles away from terminal so long bus journey to and from aircraft"
bmi Regional,Not Verified|  I was supposed to fly on the 06:25 flight from Newcastle to Brussels for a connecting flight to Slovenia. The incoming flight on the Sunday had been cancelled but I received no warning. I got to the airport at 5am to find out the flight was delayed by almost 6 hours. The young lad on the desk couldn't offer any help in getting us rerouted. I had meetings planned on the Monday afternoon. There was also no ground staff who could help. I was given a number to ring but the woman I spoke to immediately said I was given the wrong number. She did then try to look at flights but said there wasn't anything she could do. The flight took off over 6 hours late using what seemed like an old plane. A few seats were out of use and the plane had a bad smell. I was over 11 hours late into Ljubliana. An absolutely dreadful experience! It's worth bearing in mind I paid £800 for the flight.
Boliviana de Aviacion,"Not Verified| I flew with Boliviana de Aviación from Cochabamba to Madrid with my wife and two children. We flew on a B737-800 for the first (short-haul flight) from Cochabamba to Santa Cruz, and then on a A330-200 from Santa Cruz to Madrid. Very friendly service on board. Personal screens on each seat for the long flight. They could make some progress on the food tthey serve, though. This being said, we had two full meals (dinner and breakfast), unlike other airlines who only offer one free meal for the same 11-hour flight (Santa Cruz-Madrid). We arrived to Madrid on time. All in all, a very pleasant experience with BoA."
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline ever. They have no clue or understand what is a good customer service. Rude and unprofessional personnel. They moved my return flight to one day later without a valid reason and did not want to accommodate me for the extra expenses or try to help me in any way, not to mention delay flights. Do not waste your money in this 3rd world airline! Never again."
Boliviana de Aviacion,Not Verified|  All the flights we took with this company were delayed. I strongly advise to take time especially if you have connections with other flights. Unfriendly cabin crew. No onboard service. I advise against. Tous les vols que nous avons pris avec cette compagnie ont eu du retard. Je conseil fortement de prendre du délais notamment si vous avez des connexions avec d'autres vols. Personnel de cabine peu sympathique. Aucun service à bord. Je déconseille.
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified| The worst airline I have ever travelled with. From the moment you board the plane you can see that the plane is dirty and old. When I arrived in Santa Cruz, I picked up my luggage (which took too long to leave) to make the connection. After going through Customs they made me leave the hold luggage in a corner that is not even equipped with the danger that someone could take it away or get lost. Not happy with that, they make you leave the connection area to go through the boarding controls again. It is a totally improvised airline."
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified|  I ride BoA from EZE to MIA through VVI on 2/6/2023 early Morning at 5 am. When I got my baggage In the Miami baggage claim hall, I found one of my checked-in baggage was damaged. I can’t find any BoA agent in the baggage claim hall. I spend about two hours walking around Miami airport and still can’t find any BoA agent. (Maybe it is too early) I called 8005844099 but the number is not in service. After back home I write an email with pictures to claim the damage. BoA declines my claim. The BoA service is the worst. I will no longer use the BoA airline anymore."
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified|  Santa Cruz to Uyuni via La Paz. For the entire time of the flight, no flight attendants could be reached. The flight attendant alert button worked, but no one would respond. I walked the economy section of the plane to find that flight attendants were asleep! The service on the flight was unacceptable. The food gross, and the cabin quality terrible."
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified|  Miami to La Paz via Santa Cruz in 2018. The flight departed with some delay due to bag loading and towing services not available on time. However, the flight was relaxing and smooth. Dinner was good. There is no entertainment per seat. There are cabin monitors. The aircraft was an old Boeing 767-300. The pilot managed to arrive on time to catch the connecting flight to La Paz. This flight was in a B737-300 older version as well but with good service. One elements to point was the counter staff at Miami was very helpful with my bags and seat selection."
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified|  My wife and I flew from Buenos Aires to Miami this January. The airplanes appeared to be old with no entertainment flat panels, no earphone outlets, and no USB charging outlets. The seats were old fashion leather, wide and comfortable, with spacious leg rooms, and reclineable backward to almost 40 degrees, all of these made the flights very comfortable! Meals served were rather good, with frequent service of beverages of limited types, free wine was included with meals. Our experience was far better than most reviewers whose reviews we read."
Boliviana de Aviacion,"✅Trip Verified|  Santa Cruz, Bolivia to Madrid. No business check in; No business lounge; No priority boarding unless you scream to the ground staff. The plane is very old; flying business the plane was very cold inside. Asked for a blanket and was told that after the take off (in economy everyone has a blanket on their sits but apparently business is not paying enough for the ticket. No entertainment on the plane. For a trip of almost 11 hours there was nothing! No plug to charge the mobile. No amenity kit. The food was very bad quality! The sit was so uncomfortable that when I arrived all parts of my body was hurting After boarding the plane had a problem and we had to go back to the gate and leave the plane so it could be fixed. I had a connecting flight in Madrid to AMS and of course I lost the connection flight. The crew didn't know anything about anything. I was asking at what time was expected to arrive and they didn't know. I asked if they had any information about the connecting flights and once again they knew nothing. Once we land the captain didn't even apologize for the delay or gave any information on how we should proceed. Terrible experience!! Informed already my company about this and they will never use this crappie company any again.Avoid always!"
Boliviana de Aviacion,"Not Verified|  Santa Cruz to Buenos Aires. Not recommendable, my last flight was annoying because first the space between seats is to short, second the plane is way too old the facilities are aged. Time travel was fair but food during the flight is the worst and there is no due date on its meals and no clue about it."
BoraJet,"✅Verified Review|  Istanbul to Edremit. Borajet cancelled our flight while we were waiting at the gate and about to get to the plane. No representative of Borajet tried to assist us with the inconvenience; they did not even provide information as to how we should get out luggage back, nor did they offer help to make reservation for other flights. It was summer and all other flights of other airlines that we tried to reserve were full. We had to take bus and lost around 10 hours until we reached our destination. I and my husband reported this situation to Turkish Civil Aviation Authority and they ordered Borajet to pay €100 compensation per person due to breach of aviation regulations. We will never use this airline again because they do not respect their passengers."
Boutique Air,Not Verified|  Purchased a book of 10 flight vouchers for the Phoenix to Show Low route in December 2021. Boutique dropped this route in July 2022 and are dragging their feet on refunding my 7 unused vouchers. Have spoken with customer service twice in July and September and been told they would be refunded but as of October they have not.
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified|  I was a little nervous to fly after reading some of these reviews but my ticket was already purchased so I went for it! Best flying experience I've ever experienced. Both the Pendleton airport and Portland airport were easy to find and they both weren't in the major airports so didn't have to deal with TSA or people. Check in was simple and from check in to boarding was quick. Take off and landing for both flights were great, best I've experienced and little to no turbulence! Im wondering if the negative reviews were for flights taken during the months with crazy weather which would make sense as to why it would be scary so I'll probably stick to boutique air during the months with good weather! My flight home got delayed a couple hours but it honestly wasnt a big deal and they called and texted hours prior to inform me! Overall, best experience and I'll definitely be utilizing boutique air more! Definitely recommend"
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified| Cortez to Denver. My flight was cancelled 26 hours ago. There was no customer service available at the gate, as of 26 hours later, no one answers their phone number or my emails nor returns any of my messages. I was unable to rebook my flight, take my trip or even speak with anyone. And, they still have my money. This is an awful experience."
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified| I paid for a flight from Atlanta GA to Carlsbad NM. When I arrived at Boutique Air they said they didn't have time to get my luggage from American Airlines. The man at the front desk did not offer solutions he just barked statements about how I wasn't getting my luggage because they aren't flying to NM again until Sunday and there ""won't be room"" for our checked luggage. When my husband called American Airlines they show that Boutique Air signed for my luggage at 2.02pm so that man at the desk lied to me, they just didn't want to wait or they didn't want the weight. No one at Boutique Air is answering the phone. I'll never fly that little rinky dink plane again. I need my luggage or I'll continue to expand on this review."
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified|  I hope Boutique Air continues this service to altoona. I have been able to get my mother who lives in Altoona back and forth to Pittsburgh for medical treatment and advanced care she needs. The drive to Pittsburgh is atrocious and I hope boutique continues this route for a very long time. A total life saver and an awesome experience. Out of about 20 flights i have taken, only 3 have been delayed and very short about 20 minutes or so. Their customer service is outstanding and always so friendly"
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified| Massena to Boston. I flew once on the charter service on Boutique Air and multiple times on the commercial side of things. I am amazed on how professional and fun everyone is. We know about Boutique Air from living in upstate NY and so me and my 6 friends of mine chartered Boutique Air to New York City for my bachelorette party and then I often take them to Boston. I am hoping for more routes out of Massena since right now they only do Baltimore and Boston. Either way, its nice having a reliable company in my area that I can count on to get me where I need to be!"
Boutique Air,✅Trip Verified|  I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this airline experience. From the check in counter to the TSA at the local tiny airport to the pilots. It is totally a different way of flying commercial and just so much more personal. I wish more routes were like this because its such a nice experience. My flight was also 10 minutes early on arrival which allowed me to get to my next gate with ease. Thank you Boutique Air and hope to fly you again some day! (Maybe there will be wifi next time!)
Boutique Air,"Not Verified|  The customer service of Boutique Air is terrible. I had a flight from Pittsburgh to Baltimore at 4.20 pm. When I arrived at the ticket counter, there was a sign that said that the agent leaves the ticket counter everyday at 3.00 pm. I needed to check my bag because of valuable liquids in my bag, since the agent was not there, I had to take my bag through TSA where the liquids were confiscated and thrown away. Finally, when I reached my gate, I asked the agent why she leaves the ticket counter at 3.00 when we have a 4.20 flight, and her response was ""All the airlines leave at 3.00"". When I called Boutique Air customer service to complain, I immediately asked for a manager, and the representative abruptly hung up on me. I called another day and was told that a manager would return my call. Naturally, I never got a returned call. The third time I called, I wasn't able to talk with anyone. A voicemail came on requesting I leave my name and phone number and ""someone will return my call"". Again, no one called me back. This airline is terrible. They owe me over $100 for the liquids that were taken from my bag."
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified|  As someone used to flying jets and on airlines that are at the very least using the branding of a larger carrier, Boutique was a novel experience but not one I’d jump for over a legacy carrier. Then again, the business model for Boutique relies on them being the only game in town for far-flung airports. My journey home from Boston began with a call from the ticket agent as I made my way to the airport. He pulls double duty as a gate agent of sorts and wanted me to call upon arrival. He then strongly implored me to bring my bag aboard. It was a chore to lug on and off the small aircraft but I managed. The interior of the aircraft was in good condition except for the carpeting, which could have used a cleaning. There are sodas and small water bottles aboard, as well as snack size bags of pretzels and the like. One of the pilots offered us some of these before we took off on the second leg. And a lesson I learned the hard way—the cup holders are not super deep so maybe don’t buy a large coffee or any other large unsealable beverage to take aboard, lest you wear some of it during takeoff. There was significant turbulence on our approaches, especially into Baltimore. Passengers can see straight ahead and through the cockpit window as the plane shakes with the runway in sight. I don’t get air sick but people who do might want to know that. I should stress, however, that I at no point felt unsafe. Boutique offers codeshare with United, through whom I booked this trip. However, you’ll want to read the fine print, since not all Boutique fares rack up United miles."
Boutique Air,"✅Trip Verified|  They took by bag at Pittsburgh and then came out and told us that our flight would either be a few hours delayed or canceled. This was at the time of departure 5 PM - last flight out for the day to AOO (I later learned that the plane was still in AOO with mechanical problems.) Returned in about 10 minutes to tell us it had been canceled and then vanished. We were what do we do now - no one there, no bags. It took him at least another 15 minutes to return with our bags. He should have told us where he was going. No other options were given. No cars were available one way to AOO so I had to contact someone to drive from Everett PA to Pittsburgh airport which is around 120 miles away. While I waited, after waiting there 3 hours for this flight after my flight had arrived from DFW. They are so unreliable and I have been trying to get a refund on my flight or travel expenses which seem to be impossible. Very unreliable airline - no customer service."
Breeze Airways,"✅Trip Verified| I had a really great experience on this airline, this was my first time riding Breeze. I arrived an hour before the flight and missed the check bag time and couldn’t get on the plane. I texted customer service and they responded timely, even though missed flights aren’t covered, they were really understanding about my situation and gave me a refund in the form of a flight credit to take the next available flight. When I finally got a flight (it was an hour and a half flight) and we arrived 30 mins early to the destination. The plane was very clean (seemed basically brand new) the flight attendants were all very kind, the plane ride was very smooth. Overall it was a really great experience and the tickets were very affordable."
Breeze Airways,✅Trip Verified|   Breeze is the worst airline I have ever flown. 5 hour delay and a huge attitude from customer service when I could find them. I had to spend a bunch of money on airport food and extend my parking. The real kicker was the additional hour on the tarmac. I agreed to leave my preferred seat to rearrange the weight. After all of this the flight attendant still charged me for a drink. I will never fly them again. I’d rather have a layover.
Breeze Airways,"Not Verified|  Don't trust your checked bags! After preparing to hike the Grand Canyon for a year, Breeze Airways lost my baggage and hiking equipment. Finding anyone from the airline to help was very hard, and they were rude. Because there is no phone number to call, your only options are Facebook or email - no help for a customer. After more than two hours in the airport, first trying to locate anyone and then working through a process to report the loss, my bag was identified as lost. After more than five weeks, the only response I have from the airline is that my bag was lost and is under review. They cannot even provide me with a date when they will address my loss. What a great way to spend the adventure of a lifetime."
Breeze Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   After struggling with accessing Breeze links due to server issues on their end and no luck in contacting their customer service department, I attempted to ask front desk gate attendants for assistance with checking into my flight and using my points to check my bag. They immediately cut me off from completing my inquiry, refused and offered no options other than paying their $75 baggage fee. (In the policy, but I stated that I’d keep trying the website as I had for a while with no luck as other Breeze staff was able to access my account in the past.) The bag was eventually checked before entering TSA but while waiting for boarding I was approached and asked if my issue was resolved to which I said yes because the bag discussed was checked and on the plane. Staff escalated the issue, demanded I pay another $75 for my purse, yelled at me, denied me and my mother boarding, stated that I was disruptive and unsafe, and proceeded to call airport security. It took days to receive a response from Breeze and even then they never apologized for the behavior of their staff nor offered any kind of consolation. If you enjoy poor customer service, janky websites and links, waiting 3 days for a customer service response, and cheap flights, then Breeze is perfect for you! My family and I will not be flying with Breeze again after this encounter."
Breeze Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Flight MX117 schedule: leave Richmond 6:58 pm 10/26/24, arrive Tampa 9:14 pm Saturday 10/26/24 8:06 am get message: leave Richmond 12:49 am 10/27/24, arrive Tampa 3:05 am no mention of any TSA restrictions Saturday 10/26/24 12:20 pm get message Please arrive at the airport no later than 9:45 pm. (apparently TSA is not staffed after that time.) My question—If TSA is not there, how can Breeze schedule a flight at 12:49 am? Assuming I got through TSA at 9:00 pm, am I expected to sit for almost 4 hours waiting for the flight to depart--I’m 84 years old.  Saturday 10/26/24 7:19 pm get message (I’m already on the road to the airport so I can be there before 9:45): Please arrive at the airport no later than 9:15 pm. (apparently now TSA is not staffed after that new time.) So now I have 30 minutes less than what I planned on? And now I can wait for almost 4 ½ hours to depart? Saturday 10/26/24 7:30-8:30 pm: Massive accident on Rt 64 on the way to the airport. Sit for 50-60 minutes before reaching an exit. Try to use Breeze app on my iPhone. Find it impossible to cancel flight, or to schedule another flight. App is totally useless, and of course there’s no phone call possible! In desperation call my daughter, who from her home computer manages to cancel our whole trip. She gets us on a flight with Southwest. Thank heaven we weren’t relying on Breeze to get us to a connecting flight, or to a Sunday wedding, or to leave on a cruise, etc! To force people to accept a revised flight at an ungodly departure and arrival time (which is exactly what I was trying to avoid), to not inform them of TSA problems before asking then to accept a change, to make them sit for hours in an airport because of TSA problems, to have a useless app, to have no provision for talking to a human (especially in an emergency), to give such short notice on change in TSA hours—totally unacceptable, and reflects complete indifference to passengers and total incompetence in management. What I want: I have 25000 Breeze points. I would like $250 refunded, since I have no intention of flying on Breeze, ever! Breeze has the money I originally paid when I got the 25000 points; based on the “service” I got, it’s not right that Breeze should be able to keep my money and give me nothing; I repeat, nothing, in return. Also, when I printed my boarding pass and saw the seating chart, it appeared that flight MX117 was only half full. Although I can’t prove it, I suspect that we were bumped to the later flight so that flight would be full. After all, if there was a mechanical problem, was there no other plane? If the pilot was ill, was there no other pilot? The weather was perfect in both Richmond and Tampa, so that wasn’t an issue."
Breeze Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Absolute horrific experience with Breeze. My flight from Lansing to Orlando was delayed ~7 hours. On my return flight, I was emailed asking to show up to the airport early because TSA lines were expected to be extra long. They were not. I got through them in under 20 minutes. I am now sitting at the gate and we are again delayed multiple hours with no end in sight. They don't have a customer assistance telephone number. What an absolute joke of an airline. Never again."
Breeze Airways,"Not Verified| This is the 2nd time we tried to fly Breeze and the 2nd time our flight was cancelled at the gate. So disappointed for ruining my son’s 10 year old birthday weekend. We were notified by text the flight was canceled and no one even came to the gate to tell the passengers. We had to exit the gated area and go to arrivals to get some help. Help was take the refund because we have no other options today. Customer service is awful, you can’t call for help and your flights don’t actually take off. I haven’t received my refund as of yet."
Breeze Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Breeze offers a Sunday flight from Tampa to Norfolk, but our experience is that the odds of the flight actually taking place on that day are less than 50%. My wife and I are both medical professionals, and our presence at our jobs on Monday morning is required. Breeze has caused major difficulties for us more than once. This will be the last time."
Breeze Airways,"Not Verified| Breeze has to be the worst airline I have ever flown. The company started out great in 2020 and ever since then it has reached rock bottom. Customer service is a joke, delays are 3 plus hours when minimum prior notification, cancelations are frequent. You sit at the airport for hours and then they text you and say the flight was canceled. They offer 150 airline credit forcing you to have to buy another ticket from this horrendous airline instead of putting that credit towards the method of payment. This airline doesn't even seem yo try. You can not talk to a physical person. The source of communication is via text which is probably AI. If I could give this airline a negative 100 I would."
Breeze Airways,"Not Verified| I had an awful experience with Breeze Airlines. They destroyed my luggage, and to make matters worse, they refused to offer any compensation. The customer service is practically non-existent — only available via text messages, and it takes 2-3 days for them to even respond. When they finally do, they’re rude and unprofessional, almost as if they’re mocking you instead of offering real help. I can’t believe how badly they treat their customers. I will never fly with them again and strongly advise others to avoid this airline at all costs."
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Disappointing service, plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service I booked my flight directly through BA's website. Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA's so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost & Found at the airport. BA's customer service said they couldn't contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn't take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn't even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn't even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): ""It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback."" They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at Heathrow. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later. The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you'd have to ask for it especially) on this long flights. The seats were of fabric, uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep. All in all flying with British Airways was disappointing and I will not be keen on flying with them again."
British Airways,✅Trip Verified|   A transit visa is required for my partner to transit via London to Iceland. So I had to buy a separate ticket for her via another airline. When we reach Iceland I emailed British Airways telling then she won't be using her return ticket and requested for a partial refund. 2 days later. I received an email from customer service that I need to contact one of their service centres via the provided link. I replied to say the link only goes to a page with various British landline phone numbers to call and explained that I am overseas then and it will not be practical to do this via international calls. They replied to say I can only do this by contacting the service centres. So the airline end up taking my money regardless.
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   I was surprised to receive confirmation pre-flight that I had 69 kgs luggage allowance. This to be later confirmed as one at 23 kg checked in, another 23 kgs carry on for under seat, and a third 23 kgs carry on for overhead stowage. Checkin opened a bit late, and the line for Executive Club members even later, but was courteous and efficient. Long queue for passport control but the fault of Brexit, not BA. My seat had no screen; no earphone socket; no charge point; no seat recline; no boarding music. All the same as low cost carriers. Captain announced ""Wonderful service from Emily and crew"" - maybe it was in Club Class, not the economy cabin. It was announced that they would serve complimentary water and snack, but only the snack came. It was also announced there would be free text messaging for Exec Club members, but I couldn't get it to work, although a member. Snacks were sold, some at twice TUI price. For example Cadbury's chocolate fingers at £3.50. I chose BA this time as when I booked it was cheaper than all the charter carriers. And being British I mustn't forget BA's impeccable safety record and normally reliable service. After landing the Purser thanked the crew for their hard work. Seems pushing one small cart down the aisle during four hours constitutes hard work in BA. But at least we were on time."
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Flight cancelled, not refunding our money saying we took the flight that never happened. Not refunding the new flights we booked, hotels, food while we were stranded. Did not provide food or water while waiting for hours on tarmac. Will not provide information as to why they aren't refunding the flight that never happened. Saying there is no more information."
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   I had visa issues, and hence, was debarred from flying. The ground staff at Mumbai was excellent (a woman named Brinelle) was very helpful and understanding. I had to rebook my tickets, and while the original journey was consisting of 3 legs, BA forced me to rebook the entire ticket, because their system did not allow them to rebook just that one leg (even though there was a gap of 13 days between the two legs, not like they were connecting flights). The telephone operator was rude, took 45 minutes and kept saying she needed 3-4 more minutes to give me clarity. It was horrendous. The final price they offered me for rebooking 2 of the 3 legs was much more than the original fare for all 3 legs. She was torturous, BA was horrendous because the website does not allow you to do all this. A very poor experience, in all."
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   Singapore to Heathrow with BA. Two choices on this route A380 or 777-300. In economy and premium (and first) there isn’t much in it. In club world the 777 wins as it has the suite. Check in was easy. Security and passport control in Singapore is efficient. Choice of 3 lounges (BA, Qantas or Qatar) the latter wins easily. BA lounge was ok no major negatives. Qantas wins on space. Boarding was on time. The aircraft has a high density club world cabin. Service was fine. Club suite was good. It’s the food and beverages that are being targeted I feel. The 1st meal starter was good, main of beef fillet was average, same sentiment for cheese. Wines were acceptable. Champagne choice is cheap so I did not try. Service for meals efficient given the full cabin. Breakfast was similar. The menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert, for this to work for BA, a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed. As it was I slept well, we arrived early, luggage off quickly (for once) so a reasonable flight overall. My warning to BA is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction"
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|   I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! This experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines."
British Airways,"Not Verified|  I paid for seats 80 A and B on my flight from Heathrow to Boston on the A380, paying for premium economy seats. Upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said I was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old I presume (65) since there is no other reason I can find I could not sit in the exit seating. I am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. Attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. We were told our money would be refunded immediately for the ""inconvenience"". After several weeks I recontacted BA and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. The plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. They completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. The captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. We were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. We landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight."
British Airways,"Not Verified| The flight wasn’t that bad, although the Inflight entertainment wasn’t great, the screen was very old-fashioned. It was hard to operate in the dark as the touch screen wasn’t working at times. There was though a remote. The cabin crew slamming air larders (ovens and draws). Apart from that, the cabin crew were nice, the food was good and the seat was comfortable."
British Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). BA's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of Avios points each. I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. They then ghosted me. My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. I now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds."
Brussels Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Avoid Brussels Airlines—do not bother to fly with them. I was flying business class from Newark to Barcelona on February 13th, and my bags were lost. They arrived in Florence 10 days later, but Brussels Airlines never informed me, leaving me to coordinate with United, the originating airline. The only contact I received from Brussels Airlines was an email on February 27th confirming my bags were delivered to the town I was staying in, though I didn’t actually receive them until the 26th. Even with my bags in the area, their lack of coordination and communication caused unnecessary delays. Finally, after months of silence, they dismissed my claim on October 30th, citing my two-month stay in Italy as a “permanent address,” despite my round-trip ticket to the US. Their delays, automated responses, and dismissive attitude show a complete disregard for customers—even in business class. I expected far better service, but Brussels Airlines proved to be unreliable and unprofessional."
Brussels Airlines,"✅Trip Verified| Flight SN2293 on the 21st of October 2024. Efficient boarding, welcoming crew and comfortable seats. The flight left with a slight delay of 10' but arrived 20' earlier in Stockholm. The highlight was the crew. Charming, well groomed, cheerful and carried out an excellent cabin bag management during boarding. The seemed to be enjoying their jobs and their enthusiasm was contagious. It was a pleasure to fly them."
Brussels Airlines,"Not Verified| I was travelling from Brussels to Naples. My luggage didn’t arrive. The day after I received a message indicating that my luggage had been located in Frankfurt. I had no news for a couple of days and then received an email telling me that an agent will contact me. An agent never contacted me ; on the contrary, I called the customer service with an Indian agent who told me that the luggage was not in Naples airport. I read reviews online that were saying to go directly to the airport so after several days we decided to return to Naples airport. Nobody at the airport knew if and where my luggage would be but they allowed me at the airport to check in a couple of different rooms. I finally found the luggage in a dodgy underground room. During all those days, I didn’t have any of my clothes nor basic necessities so I had to buy everything I needed. When upon return to Brussels I asked for indemnification for those items I had bought, I received an email from the customer service telling me that I had been notified that my luggage was available at the Naples airport - which never happened. Worst customer service ever."
Brussels Airlines,"✅Trip Verified|   I am thoroughly frustrated and disappointed by the lack of action and customer service from Brussels Airlines. My flight from Vilnius to Geneva was cancelled on May 12, and I promptly submitted a compensation claim. On May 23, the airline confirmed my compensation entitlement of €400 per passenger. Since then, I have been waiting for payment, which was promised to be processed within 6 to 8 weeks. It's now September 30, and I still have not received any compensation. I have sent over 20 emails and submitted 2 new claims on their website, but have received no response. I've also made 3 phone calls to the customer service center, sent a direct email to the head of customer service, and still nothing. This lack of communication and disregard for customer rights is appalling. Under European law, specifically EC Regulation 261/2004, passengers are entitled to compensation when a flight is cancelled. Brussels Airlines is clearly violating this regulation by failing to honor their commitments. It is unacceptable that an airline would promise a 72-hour response time but not fulfill this or even acknowledge the claim after more than 4 months. This is a serious breach of consumer rights, and I urge Brussels Airlines to finally pay attention to my claim and settle the compensation as required by law."
Brussels Airlines,"Not Verified| I was treated badly on flight SN 2103, seat 17D to London at 21:20 on 29/10/2024. I took a wrong way by mistake and the lady from cabin crow was rude. She should have been more polite. She also asked me to weigh my suitcase, which I use every time I fly. The suitcase weighed 10.8 kg, but she said it was only allowed to weigh 8 kg and couldn't be carried inside. I'll be looking at other options for future flights to London, even though I'm a member of Miles and More. I'm also taken three flights per month to London. British Airways offers a better service when I compare."
Brussels Airlines,"Not Verified| Absolutely useless. Not only did they manage to lose all six of our bags, packed to the brim with equipment that we actually need to do our job, but now they’re playing some absurd game of pass the parcel with them. First, they tell me they’ve handed the bags off to a delivery company — brilliant, I think, progress at last — but of course, the number they gave me to ring them doesn’t even work. No surprises there. So, I go online, trying to find any hint of where our bags are, and the delivery company says they’ve never even seen them. Not a trace. It's as if these people take perverse pleasure in making life as difficult as humanly possible. This is hands down the worst airline I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. The incompetence is staggering."
Brussels Airlines,Not Verified|  Surprisingly good experience. Cabin staff were unbelievably attentive and helpful. Food and beverages were excellent for airline food. Boarding and deboarding were well organized. Only downside was business configuration was 2-2-2 and flat bed was not as comfortable as on other airlines.
Brussels Airlines,"Not Verified|  Check in started very slowly at the airport with the employee getting out of the counter to check the line length instead of working to decrease it. Weird, but it is okay, we are on vacation. Flight was delayed two hours and we spent one hour inside the aircraft just sitting there - took a power nap, all good. But arrived in Brussels and my luggage was completely damaged. Filed a report, got a reference number, went to the Dolfi site as instructed, filled all documentation and waited. Today an email arrives saying: ""Dear passenger, Unfortunately we cannot proceed with the case, as the documents required by the airline have not been included or are not complete. Please send us the missing documents via email: - damage report from the airport We can only proceed with the case when the documents are complete. Thank you for your cooperation. We are looking forward to your reply."" Terrible customer service!"
Brussels Airlines,"Not Verified|  And even 1 star is still too much! Seats booked in row 1 (we thought we saw it from the online photo/drawing) 23 pp there and 23 back, so a total of 92 euros. My husband is 2m+ and also quite coarse and has a problem with his knees due to an operation in the past. I have edema in my legs and fly with support/compression material and then it is not always pleasant to sit in one position for long flights. And they also have to be taken off after a certain moment because otherwise the position will pinch and then stretching is nice. Please note that walking ensures that the legs fill up again and so do sitting back in that position. Outward journey (the day before we received an announcement that we had been rebooked. Immediately reported that we didn't think this was nice because you first make us pay for more expensive seats and then we disappear into a row behind them for 14 euros. The difference is almost 10 pp. About 2 hours Later we suddenly receive an email: do you want to book business class seats with a rate of 190 pp? I thought, how is this possible, because I apparently missed it on the drawing of the seat reservation? Immediately contacted us and Brussels Airlines assured that we did NOT have us for us but a cabin and that business was separate... Well, those people who have now paid 190 euros must have enjoyed this bit of extra service!! 3 glasses of champagne every half hour the question is everything to your liking? And with a length of 1.65 all the extra space? To then sit in 1 in the same room and go to the same toilet and the Seats we had originally booked were NOT involved! And even across the row, other people from behind unceremoniously moved for the business seats!!! The purser did not blink or blush and had even indicated to the stewardess that he found this quite antisocial! Answer, sorry, then you should have paid for more expensive seats and you have more space at the emergency exit (that is not entirely true!) On the return journey the drama was even greater and it is the first and last time ever that I flew with this airline!  En zelfs 1 ster is nog te veel! Seats geboekt op rij 1 (dachten we met de online foto/tekening te zien) 23 p.p heen en 23. Terug dus totaal 92 euro. Mijn man is 2m+ en ook best grof en een probleem met de knieën door een operatie in het verleden. Ikzelf heb oedeem aan mijn benen en vlieg met steun/compressie materiaal en dan is lang vliegen niet altijd fijn in 1 houdin te zitten. En ze moeten ook uit na een bepaald moment omdat die houding anders knelt en dan is strekken fijn. Let wel lopen zorgt ervoor dat de benen weer vollopen en terug zitten in die houding dus ook. Heenreis( dag ervoor een mededeling dat we waren omgeboekt. Meteen gemeld dat we dit niet netjes vonden want je laat ons eerst duurdere Seats betalen en vervolgens verdwijnen we een rij erachter voor 14 euro. Verschil is dus bijna 10. Pp. Een kleine 2 uur later krijgen we ineens mail wilt u business class Seats boeken met een tarief van 190!! Pp? Ik dacht nog huh hoe kan dit want op de tekening van stoel reservering heb ik die blijkt gemist?  Meteen contact gezocht en Brussel airlines verzekerde dat we GEEN wij voor ons hadden maar cabine en dat business apart was… Nou wat zullen die mensen die nu dus 190 euro betaald hebben genoten hebben van dit stukje extra service zeg!! 3 glazen champagne elk half uur de vraag alles naar wens? En met 1.65 lengte alle extra ruimte? Om vervolgens in 1 in dezelfde ruimte te zitten en naar dezelfde toilet te gaan en de Seats die we oorspronkelijk geboekt hadden dus NIET betrokken waren! En trokken er zelfs aan de overkant van de rij andere mensen van achter zonder pardon om de business Seats!!! De purser verblikte of bloosde niet en had zelfs bij de stewardess aangegeven dit behoorlijk asociaal te vinden! Antwoord, sorry dan had u maar duurdere stoelen moeten betalen en u heeft meer ruimte bij de nooduitgang( dat is dus niet geheel waar!) Op de terugreis was het drama zelfs nog veel groter en is het meteen de eerste en laatste keer ooit dat ik met deze maatschappij heb gevlogen!"
Brussels Airlines,✅Trip Verified| Brussels airlines is the best! I left my laptop on plane and sent an email to lost and found and 4 hours later when I was at United gate for connecting flight someone brought it to me. I had written an email to the airline’s lost and found. Best customer service ever!! Thank you Brussels Airlines!!! You are the best.
Buddha Air,"✅Trip Verified| It has been a while since I had flown this company but unfortunately their offering is poor and service appears to have deteriorated, in spite of them being considered the more 'reputable' airlines in Nepal, with a general lack of professionalism in all areas. I was at the airport 1.5 hours ahead of departure, as instructed on the ticket - but it was total chaos. Everyone was standing around with no place to sit and I was told the desk (just a kiosk in a large crowded hall) wasn't open yet. I had to stand amongst the crowd for almost 40 mins before it finally opened - why couldn't they have just checked us in and let us rest in the waiting lounge? The flight was about an hour late, which is actually not bad considering the frequent disruption in Nepal's airspace. On board, the plane interiors looked tired and rundown and clearly were in need of refurbishment. The cabin crew were polite, but there was absolutely no in flight service, not even a glass of water - a few years ago I remember being offered a snack and drink. The return was a drama. My flight was cancelled the day before, and the new flight was delayed by 2 hours, but when I arrived at the airport, I was on put on a different earlier flight which was also delayed - very confusing. Fortunately there is a proper luggage reclaim system in operation now, unlike in the past when it was all manual. For this generally poor service, the price was pretty outrageous - $204 return for a half an hour flight and this was apparently the lowest fare available, when you can get tickets on a similar flight in India or Europe for $70-80. Note that this is a monopoly fare just for 'foreigners' - prices for Nepali and Indian citizens are less than half. It is actually very sad, as these companies should be trying to support tourism and contributing to national development - yet instead they see guests to Nepal as an opportunity to make a quick buck, and think that foreigners will put up with this sub-standard service and will be happy to pay a premium for it. Very bad for Nepal's international reputation and serious government regulation needed to reign these companies in."
Buddha Air,"✅Trip Verified| We had a flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu as per the image attached, it got delayed by 2 hours, we missed our international flight from Kathmandu and lost 50000INR. It's not unforgivable as weather conditions are out of anybody's control. But what made us feel bad was the arrogant behaviour from the man in charge of the boarding gate. He was so rude on my enquiry about the delay that we felt as if we were beggars travelling free of cost in your flight. So, I would like to remind you people that you should refrain from appointing such merciless ones on your counters. Afterall, we spent our hard earned money for your flight! So at least ask them to be sympathetic on the flight delays that are going to happen in the future."
Buddha Air,Not Verified|  Counter attendant in Kathmandu have no manners while dealing with passenger. The worse experience while traveling with Budhha Air.
Buddha Air,"✅Trip Verified| Such a shameless worst service I have ever taken. I have chosen Buddha Air 3 times up to now and Buddha Air is always delayed. 1.5 hrs delayed and they kept us inside the bus for the whole 1.5 hrs in this heat. They said they were maintaining the tire first and they said their airplane’s door needed maintenance again. February 2, 2023 is going to be my last flight with Buddha Air. Worst service and worst passenger handling. The crew members don’t even know how to handle the crowd. Buddha Air - never again."
Buddha Air,✅Trip Verified|  Each and every time this airlines flights has been delayed by minimum of 30 minutes. If thats the case then they must early inform all the passenger either by email or by a text to their respective mobile so that we dont have to wait inside an airport for over more than 2 hours. I had a flight in 01 feb 2023 at 1045 and now the flight has been merged with 1145. At least they could early inform. What a shame to Buddha Air. Customer satisfaction is in negative level.
Buddha Air,✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline. I will not fly any more with this airline. Unprofessional customer service. Feel ashamed to say it’s my country airlines
Buddha Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Very inconvenient, lack of efficient communication. Buddha air should value their customers and theirs time. I had multiple travels last month all of those flights were 1-2 hours late. It would be helpful if they can announce incase of those scenarios for elderly customers."
Buddha Air,Not Verified|  Bad experience: we had other flights too and were always late: unprofessional and unorganised at the airport counter: will never fly again with this airline.
Buddha Air,"Not Verified|  Biratnagar to Kathmandu. I waited for 5 hours just to be notified that my flight was cancelled. I arrived airport at 1600 to catch my 17:25 hrs flight, we kept on asking if our flight was ready they told us our flight was being held but surely we would fly at 1800 hrs. But it was around 2100 hrs after boarding they told us our flight was cancelled as the pilot told his time was up! Disgusting and unprofessional."
Buddha Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Bharatpur to Kathmandu. Flights are always delayed and you often can't even find online updates. Basically, you arrive to the airport in the morning and the delay can be anything from 2 hours to 5."
Bulgaria Air,✅Trip Verified|   I boarded the aircraft and there was no space for my standard cabin luggage of 10 kg. It was full of backpacks which usually must be placed under the seat but the cabin staff didnt bother to remove any of the backpacks and a stewardess was trying to explain to me that space for cabin luggage is not as per the standards. I had seat at row 25 and finally they found a space above seat 1 which is not acceptable since upon landing I had to walk against the other passengers in order to collect my cabin luggage or to wait all passengers to leave the aircraft. Unfortunately this is the only airline which you can use for local flights in Bulgaria. Poor quality service and unreasonably high air tickets.
Bulgaria Air,"✅Trip Verified| On the 5.07.24 after many many attempts I have finally got to speak to Bulgaria Air representative regarding an issue with the booking of my checking luggage. Turn it out I have not made the booking for luggage for my return flight. In order to make that extra booking, I was sent a link to make a payment via email. Payment was made I received my receipt and I went along with my journey! As I was attempting to Check in my luggage before my flight back on the 20.07.24, I was surprised to find out that the luggage was not included on my boarding pass, So I had to pay again because the airport staff did not recognise nor accept the receipt I have received for my payment! Now a day after my flight after near 50 attempts, I’m still unable to contact Bulgaria Air on their phone number! I would recommend for everybody to stay away from that company unless absolutely necessary. Sometimes it’s better to pay a little bit more but have a nice flight and have everything arranged."
Bulgaria Air,"✅Trip Verified|  Absolutely awful service. I had a flight booked originally on the 2nd of February 2022. I asked a few days before the flight if it was going to happen they said yes. It was cancelled and they offered my money back or to reschedule the flight for the 05/02/2022 to which I said yes re-schedule it. I receive an email with my ticket. On the day of the flight they said I was in the system but not on the plane - after which they told me to go and ask a help desk located in the airport. They said i cannot board the plane, and that the only way for me to fly on the day is to buy a new ticket, and the money to the newly bought ticket would be returned. I sent e-mails pictures of boarding passes and they said it would take them 2 months to process my issue. 10 months later I did not receive any answer so I emailed them. They returned the money for the first flight which was 150lev cheaper. The money I got refunded was not even the full amount! People are struggling to make ends meet and they don’t even bother to fix your issue and in the end they return not even the full amount of money. Absolutely unbelievable! I would never recommend flying with them, super unprofessional!"
Bulgaria Air,✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline ever and worst customer service ever. Will never fly with them again and would recommend avoiding. Incredibly unprofessional agents. They made a mistake boarding after a delay that resulted in further delay and missing our connection (for which we had a 3 hour layover). Since it wasn’t over three hours they claim to owe us nothing. Their mistake resulted in a partially missed trip and over $800 additional travel expenses. Worst airline ever. I sincerely hope the gate agent for that flight was fired after her behavior. It was appalling.
Bulgaria Air,"✅Trip Verified|  This was the most amusing flight I have ever flown as I got to share some laughs with not only fellow passengers, but with a hostess. Anyway, I was seated in row 9; row 10 was an exit row so I was invited to sit there since it was empty and was willing/able to assist in case of an emergency. Te leg room is excellent, and I measure 183cm. The staff were professional and courteous. Bags came out quickly. We were given water upon boarding, then a chocolate bar, then a croissant filled with chocolate sauce (worth the calories) and finally a small drink."
Bulgaria Air,"✅Trip Verified|  I have travelled multiple times with them alone, with the kids and bought tickets for my dad and I had everytime struggle. One flight they told me at the check in that the strollers they do not put in bags and I was suppose to know that which I didnt so my stroller came broken in the us. Very unprofessional and the team is the same. They have wonderful flights with great connections and prices but because I had so many times struggle with them I will not book a flight with them. And I am Bulgarian!"
Bulgaria Air,"Not Verified|  One of the worst services I've ever encountered. I was told I'm no longer on the flight less than 24 hours before departure. I emailed on the 22nd of April asking if I can receive a refund for my flight, which I did not receive. I was given alternative options such as rebooking my flight for a future date, but not once was I told that my flight would be or has been cancelled for me, only to find out myself a few hours before the flight. The woman I spoke to on the phone was very rude and unprofessional, ignoring my emails and ending the call on me several times. This flight was important for me to take as I had a connecting flight after, and I was told that the only way I could take the flight is if I upgrade and pay 400 levs. I paid for my original ticket, and for it to be cancelled for me without any notice is absurd, any other airline would at least email me or let me know? I have been on many flights and I have never encountered something like this."
Bulgaria Air,"✅Trip Verified|  So disappointed. I will never fly with this airline again. The most undereducated, complete even lack of try to understand arguments. My children 7 and 10 are flying today unattended by an adult with flight attendant. According to UK Government rules children under 11 do not need Covid test. I tried to reason with the check-in agent who wouldn't even hear what I had to say. Their tickets were detained by the airline staff and I had to pay GBP 420 so they could come home"
Bulgaria Air,✅Trip Verified| I was booked to fly but travel restrictions prevented our even getting to Bulgaria. We were promised a refund but never heard more and Air Bulgaria stopped responding to emails.
Bulgaria Air,"✅Trip Verified|  When lockdowns started because of corona in March 2020 in South America, I was stuck in Peru. After 30 days of waiting for rescue flight back to Europe, finally I was able to go home. Rescue flight was operated by British Airways and they flew from Lima to London. Since I can't enter UK without visa, I had to buy ticket out of London asap as I land. There were no flights on the same day, but there was a flight on the next one operating by Bulgaria Air from London to Sofia. I purchased that ticket. I was about to wait 24 hours at the airport and I was fine with it. Meanwhile, Bulgaria Air canceled that flight and rescheduled for the next day. That was not fine for me as I can't spend 2 days at the airport waiting for the flight. I purchased another, more expensive flight through different city and went back home. It's almost a year and Bulgaria Air still didn't refund me my money. I tried to explain them that since they didn't operate the flight I purchased ticket for, they have no rights to keep my money. They give me some lame explanations that it takes them longer time to return money or that I can reschedule that ticket for another flight. Which one, I am asking, when whole Europe is locked at the moment. I don't want to travel, I just want my 200 euros back."
Buraq Air,Benghasi Domestic to Tripoli Domestic. What a nice surprise! Buraq Air is the 4 year old private airline in Libya that operates domestically as well as to Cairo and Istanbul. It is the vastly preferred carrier to Libyan Arab Airlines. My flight from Benghasi (domestic) to Tripoli (domestic) was easy to purchase in town (not on Sabre or Galilleo unfortunately) and was just $38 one way. The domestic airport is nothing to write home about but is clean and Benghasians are very friendly with smiles all round. This flight operated with a rather long-in-the-tooth 737-200 you know the ones with long cigar-shaped engines but was clean and the cabin crew were polite engaging and presented themselves in smart uniforms smiles all round again. This was an all economy configuration but legroom was more than European airlines in J class. Soft drinks hot drinks and some cakes made a break during the 90 minute flight.
Buta Airways,"Not Verified| We bought tickets before the Pandemic and can't have our money back since then! Since that time they write to us that we need to wait the regular flights to start operating. According to their website, they have been already flying all regular routes. Never buy tickets in Buta Airways."
Buta Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Tehran to Baku. The prices they offer are very reasonable, however, their service is very low level. Nothing is interesting about Buta Airways, but for a short flight from Tehran to Baku it was not a bad option."
Buta Airways,Not Verified| Baku to Ankara. Baku to Ankara. Buta Airways charge 25 euros for carry on luggage if you have budget class tickets. This practice is misleading. I will avoid this airline in the future.
Buta Airways,✅Trip Verified|  Baku to Tblisi. Buta Airways charge 25 euros for carry on luggage if you have budget class tickets.  This practice is misleading. I will avoid this airline in the future.
Buta Airways,"✅Trip Verified| Baku to Kiev with Buta Airways. I have to say after travelling for 10 years this was definitely the best Low Cost Carrier I have ever flown with. On time and sharp. Plus you get free water and a free sandwich. But saying that, for a 500ml beer is 1.5€ and a pizza 2€. Incredible value you money. I had flown them for a 55min flight, so was interested to see what a 3.5hour flight would be like. But it was absolutely perfect."
Buta Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Tbilisi to Baku. Everything went smoothly here. Boarding was quick and on time. We were pushed back on time, which also meant the flight left on time. It was only a short hop of 55mins. I will see how they are again when I fly 3 hours plus on my next flight. Overall No issues. Airline very smooth and would recommend."
Buta Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Kazan to Baku. It's not really a low cost airline, because the cost is not low and quality is even lower than a usual lowcost. But I had no choice. Hand luggage is not included, it is made clear on their website.  But the problem is that you can't pay for the hand luggage on their website, you have to pay at check-in counter. And they force you to pay in different currency using their crazy exchange rate, so you will overpay for it a lot. The reason, as they explained it, it is because they need to check your bag (size and weight) to see if it will fit. Can't they allow to pay for it online and deal with overweight bags at the airport for extra cost? My bag was within the limits, but I had to pay more.  Surprisingly, seats were pretty comfortable and spacious enough for tall people. They even gave a free sandwich. But tea/coffee was not free. Anyway, I can't recommend to fly with Buta."
Buta Airways,"✅Trip Verified|  Baku to Tbilisi. I had 2 terrible experiences with Buta Airways. First flight was delayed 3 hours for no reason. Then at check-in, I was fined for not checking in online, however there is no mention on the ticket or confirmation email anywhere that you need to do online check-in. I asked for a window seat and was given an Aisle, when I asked to move onboard (as the flight wasn't full), I was told it would cost €25! They also don't allow any hand luggage, apart from a handbag or laptop bag. Not even a plastic bag! Now my return flight is also delayed 4 hours. All in all, a very poor experience."

Camair-Co,"✅Trip Verified|  Garoua to Douala in Cameroon. Didn't really have a choice as Camair-Co is the only airline that flies this route. Scheduled for 6:15pm local, the flight was delayed by 10 hours, pax were not notified. Only came to know about this when I went to the airport - which was full of confused passengers and no staff. A sign was written on a piece of paper - this was the only notice the airline provided. No other details. No arrangements were made for the delay - no food, no water no accommodation etc. Absolutely ridiculous. The aircraft finally arrived at 3:10 am. It did not depart till 4:30am - a full 10 hours after the scheduled departure time. The reason for the delay was not notified to the passengers. We were made to board the aircraft and just sit inside, while there was a huge commotion going on in the cockpit. Apparently the pilots refused to take off as they had ended their shifts. The flight only took off after the police were called and there were physical altercations with the pilots. What a joke of an airline. The people running this airline ought to be ashamed of themselves. Will never fly them ever again. 0/10."
Camair-Co,"✅Verified Review|  Douala to Maroua. The most unpleasant flying experience of my life. The first question you have to ask with this alrline - the national airline of Cameroon, is ""will the flight actually happen""? Outwards things were not too bad. The return was another matter. The flight from Maroua to Douala was cancelled as the scheduled 737 was out of action. A 757 was scheduled for the next day, but it meant travelling to another airport three hours away by coach as the runway at Maroua is too short for a 757. The coach left Maroua at 05.00 for a flight from Garoua at around midday. On arriving at Garoua we were told the flight would now be at 16.00, maybe. The plane actually arrived around 18.00 and we took off around 19.00. There was absolute chaos on boarding, and I had to physically fight to get on the plane - a very frightening experience. After an unscheduled stop at Yaoundé for a hour we eventually arrived at Douala around 23.00. The only positive was that the Cabin crew were charming and helpful under stress. Camair-Co are renowned for cancelling flights with no explanation."
